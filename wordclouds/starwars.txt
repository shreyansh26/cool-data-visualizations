A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away....
STAR
WARS
Episode Vll / b
THE FORCE AWAKENS/ b
Luke Skywalker has vanished.
In his absence, the sinister
FIRST ORDER has risen from
the ashes of the Empire
and will not rest until
Skywalker, the last Jedi,
has been destroyed.
With the support of the
REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa
leads a brave RESISTANCE.
She is desperate to find her
brother Luke and gain his
help in restoring peace
and justice to the galaxy.
Leia has sent her most daring
pilot on a secret mission
to Jakku, where an old ally
has discovered a clue to
Luke's whereabouts . . . .
This will begin to make things right.
I've traveled too far
and seen too much
to ignore the despair
in the Galaxy.
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.
The general has been after
for this for a long time.
The General?
To me she's royalty.
Well, she certainly is that.
We got company.
You have to hide.
You have to leave.
Go.
Get out!
Go! Go! Go!
Come on BB-8, hurry!
Blast that X-wing!
Fire! Fire!
Someone is coming behind us.
I see him!
And take this, it's safer
with you than it's with me.
You get as far away
from here as you can.
- Do you hear me?
- I don't know...
I'll come back for you!
We'll be alright!
Keep moving!
Stay here.
Look how old you'd become.
Something far worse
has happened to you.
You know what I've come for.
I know where you come from.
Before you you call 'Kylo Ren'.
The Map, to Skywalker.
We know you found it.
And now you're going to
give it to the First Order.
The First Order rose
from the dark side.
You did not.
I'll show you
the dark side.
You may try.
But you cannot deny the truth
that is your family.
You're so right.
So, who talks first?
Do you talk first? I talk first?
The old man gave it to you.
It's very hard to understand you
with all the...
- Search him.
- I'm more than...
- Nothing, sir.
- Bring him on board.
Sir, the villagers?
Kill them all.
On my command.
Fire!
No!
Nothing here!
Eliminate it!
Huh?
Alright.
Alright!
FN-2187.
Submit your blaster for inspection.
Yes, Captain.
And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?
I'm sorry, Captain.
Report to my division at once.
What you brought me today
is worth...
One quarter portion.
(AT-AT)
Huh?
Oh, thank you.
Shhh.
That's just a Teedo.
Wants you for parts.
He has no respect for anyone.
Oh.
Your antenna's bent.
Where'd you come from?
I am not suppose to tell,
it's classified.
- Classified, really?
- Yup.
Me too.
Big secret.
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.
Keep away from the
sinking fields in the North
or you'll drown in the sand.
You are so very kind.
I would like to come with you.
Don't follow me.
The town is that way.
Oh.
Then, can I stay with you?
No!
I am scared.
Yay!
In the morning, you go.
Thank you, again.
You're welcome.
I have no idea we had the best pilot
in the Resistance on board.
You comfortable?
Not really.
I'm impressed.
No one has been able
to get out of you
what you did with the map.
You might want to
rethink your technique.
Where is it?
The Resistance will not be
intimidated by you.
Where is it?
AAWWWW !!
It's in a droid.
A BB unit.
Well then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.
I leave that to you.
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.
Whoever it's you're waiting for.
Classified.
I know all about waiting
For my family.
They'll be back,
one day.
Come on.
These five pieces are worth...
Let me see...
One half portion.
Last week they were
a half portion each.
What about the droid?
What about him?
I'll pay for him.
Wow.
60 portions.
- Whoa.
- Wow.
Actually.
The droid is not for sale.
Come on.
Follow the girl
and get that droid.
Ren wants the prisoner.
Turn here.
Listen carefully.
If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.
What?
This is a rescue.
I'm helping you escape.
Can you fly a TIE fighter?
You are with the Resistance?
What? No no no.
I'm breaking you out.
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.
Why?
Why are you helping me?
Because it's the right thing to do.
You need a pilot.
I need a pilot.
We're gonna do this.
Yeah?
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.
I am calm.
I'm talking to myself.
Not yet.
Okay, go.
This way.
I always wanted to fly
one of these things.
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.
Okay, same principle.
Use the toggle on the left to switch
between missiles, cannons and Mag pulses.
The sight on the right to aim,
triggers to fire.
This is very complicated.
I can fix this.
We have an unsanctioned
departure from Bay 2.
Alert General Hux,
and stop that fighter.
Blow up the command.
I got it.
This thing really moves.
Alright, we got to take out as
many of these cannons as we can
- if we're gonna get very far.
- Alright.
I'm going to get us in position.
Just stay sharp.
Up ahead! Up ahead!
Do you see it?
I got us dead centered.
It's a clean shot.
I got it.
- Yeah!
- Yes!
Did you see that?
Did you see that?
I saw it!
- Hey. What's your name?
- FN-2187.
F... what?
That's the only name
they ever gave me.
Well, I ain't using it.
FN, huh?
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.
Is it alright?
Finn. Yeah!
Finn, I like that!
I like that.
I'm Poe, Poe Dameron.
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn!
Sir, they've taken out our turbo lasers.
Use the ventral cannons.
Yes, sir.
Bringing them online.
General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?
Yes, and he had helped
from one of our own.
We are checking the registers now
to identify which Stormtrooper it was.
The one from the Village.
FN-2187.
Sir, ventral cannons on.
Fire.
What's coming towards you?
My right. Your left. Do you see it?
Hold on.
I see them!
Nice shot!
Where're we going?
We're going back to Jakku,
that's where.
No, no, no.
We can't go back to Jakku.
We need to get out
of this system.
I got to get my droid
before the First Order does.
- What? A droid?
- That's right.
The BB unit, orange and white.
One of a kind.
I don't care what color he is!
No droid can be that important!
This one is, man.
We need to get as far away
from the First Order as we can.
We go back to Jakku,
we die.
The droid has a map that leads
straight to Luke Skywalker.
Oh, you got to be kidding me!
FN-2187 reported to my division,
was evaluated and sent to reconditioning.
No prior signs of nonconformity?
This was his first offense.
General.
They've been hit.
- Destroyed?
- Disabled.
They've headed back to Jakku.
The CIS projected the crash
in the Goazon Badlands.
They were going
back for the droid.
Send a squad to the wreckage.
Poe!
Poe!
Poe!
Poe! I got you.
Poe!
Poe!
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it, we must.
How capable are your soldiers, General?
I won't have you
question my methods.
They are obviously skilled
at committing high treason.
Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.
My men are exceptionally trained.
Programmed from birth.
Then, they should have
no problem retrieving the droid,
unharmed.
Careful, Ren, that your personal interest
not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.
I want that map.
For your sake,
I suggest you get it.
Water.
Water.
- Water.
- No.
There's no water?
Girl, your droid.
I want it.
- Huh?
- What?
Oi!
Get away from him!
Hey!
Huh?
Who are those people.
They work for Unkar.
Mistress! That man!
Who?
That man over there.
- Him?
- Yes.
He is wearing my master's jacket.
What is your hurry, thief?
What?
Thief?
Oww!
Hey! What?
The jacket.
This droid says you stole it.
I had a pretty
messed up day, alright?
So I'd appreciate it if
you'd stop accusing me...
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where did you get it?
It belongs to his master.
It belongs to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?
He was captured
by the First Order.
I helped him escape,
our ship crashed.
Poe didn't make it.
Ohhh.
I tried to help him
but I'm sorry.
So you're with the Resistance?
Obviously.
Yes, I am
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.
I'm with the Resistance.
I never met a
Resistance fighter before.
I was... that's what we look like.
Some of us.
Others look different.
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.
He has to get back to your base.
Apparently he has a map
that leads to Luke Skywalker.
And everyone is after it.
Luke Skywalker?
I thought he was a myth.
What?
- What are you doing?
- Come on.
Come on, BB-8!
- Let go of me!
- Come on! We got to move!
I know how to run
without you holding my hand.
BB-8, stay close!
This way.
Call in the air strike.
They're shooting at both of us.
Yeah, they saw you with me.
You are marked.
Well, thanks for that.
Hey! I'm not the one to
take you down with a stick.
Does anyone have blasters around here?
Are you okay?
Shh. Shh.
Shhh.
Stop taking my hand!
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Follow me.
We can't outrun them!
We might.
In that Quad-Jumper!
Hey!
We need a pilot!
We got one.
You?
What about that ship?
That one's GARBAGE!
The garbage will do.
Gunner position is down there!
You ever fly this thing?
No!
This ship hasn't flown in years.
Great.
I can do this.
I can do this.
I can do this.
I can do this.
Hey!
That's mine!
Hold!
Stay low! Stay low!
What?
Stay low!
It confuses their tracking.
- BB-8, hold on.
- Whyee?
I'm going low!
What are you doing back there?
Are you ever going to fire back?
I'm working on it!
Are the shields up?
Not so easy without a co-pilot.
Try sitting in this thing.
- We need cover, quick.
- We're about to get some!
I hope.
Whoa.
Damn it.
Come on, come on!
Nice shot!
I'm getting pretty good at this.
Let's get down!
Alright. The cannon's stuck in
forward position. I can't move it.
You got to lose them.
Get ready!
Okay.
For what?
Are we really doing this?
Oh, no.
Whoa!
- That was some flying.
- Nice shooting.
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?
But I've never left the planet.
- Your last shot was great.
- That was amazing.
You set me up for it.
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.
You're okay.
He's with the Resistance.
Hmm.
He's going to get you home.
We both will.
I don't know your name.
Finn.
What's yours?
I'm Rey.
Rey...
Help me with this.
Quick!
What-What's going on?
Sir, we were unable to
acquire the droid on Jakku.
He escaped capture on a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.
The droid... stole a freighter?
Not exactly, sir.
It had help.
We have no confirmation,
but we believe FN-2187
may have helped him escape.
Anything else?
The two were accompanied by a girl.
What girl?
It's the motivator.
Grab me a Harris wrench.
Check in there.
- How bad is it?
- If we want to live, not good.
They're hunting for us now.
We got to get out of this system!
BB-8 says the location of the
Resistance base is 'need to know.'
If I'm taking you there,
I need to know.
This?
You got to tell us
where your base is.
What?
No.
I don't speak that.
Okay, between us,
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.
But if you tell us
where the base is,
I'll get you there first.
Deal?
Droid, please!
Pilex driver, hurry.
- So,where is your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her .
Huh?
Eh.
Huh?
Eh.
Huh?
Please.
- The Ileenium System!
- Yes, the Ileenium System.
That's the one.
Get us there as fast as you can.
I need the engine tape, hurry.
- What about you?
- I got to get back to Jakku?
Back to Jakk... Why does everyone
want to go back to Jakku?
- It's not that one.
- That place is...
No.
No.
The one I'm pointing to.
No. No.
No!
If we don't patches up the
propulsion, the tank will overflow
and fill up this ship
with poisonous gas.
- This?
- Yes.
Hey, Rey,
you're a pilot.
You can fly anywhere.
Why go back?
You got a family?
You got a boyfriend?
A cute boyfriend?
None of your business, that's why.
- That can't be good.
- To the cockpit.
Someone's locked on to us.
All controls are overridden.
Get off.
Get off!
Do you see anything?
Oh, no.
It's the First order.
What do we do?
There must be something.
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.
Can you unfix it?
Come on, BB-8.
I got him.
I'm okay.
Do you think this work
on the Stormtroopers?
Yeah, their masks filter out
smoke not toxins.
Hurry, they're coming.
Chewie.
We're home.
Where are the others?
Where's the pilot?
I'm the pilot.
- You?
- She's lying.
No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.
You can understand that thing?
And "that thing" can
understand you too, so watch it.
Come on out of there.
- Where did you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.
Jakku?
That junkyard?
Thank you!
Junkyard.
I told you we should've double
check the Western Reaches.
Who had her?
Ducain?
I stole it.
From Unkar Plutt.
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.
Who stole it from me!
Well, you tell him that
Han Solo just stole back
the Millennium Falcon, for good
This is the "Millennium Falcon"?
You are Han Solo?
I used to be.
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?
No, the smuggler.
Wasn't he a war hero?
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs.
12!
Hey!
Some moof milker put a compressor
on the ignition line.
Unkar Plutt did it.
I thought it was a mistake too.
Puts too much...
- ... stress on the hyperdrive.
- Stress on the hyperdrive.
Chewie, throw them in a pod.
We'll drop them on the
nearest uninhabited planet.
Wait, no!
We need your help.
My help?
This droid has to get to the
Resistance base as soon as possible.
He's carrying a map
to Luke Skywalker.
You are the Han Solo
that fought with the Rebellion.
You knew him.
Yeah, I knew him.
I knew Luke.
Don't tell me a
Rathtar's gotten loose.
Wait, what?
Did you just say 'Rathtar'?
Hey!
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?
I'm hauling Rathtars.
Oh, great.
It's the Guavian Death Gang .
They must've tracked us from Nantoon.
What is a rathtar?
They are big and
they are dangerous.
You ever heard of the Trillia massacre?
- No.
- Good.
I got three of them
going to King Prana.
Three?
How did you get them on board?
We used to have a bigger crew.
Get below and stay there
until I say so.
And don't even think
about taking the Falcon.
What about BB-8?
He stays with me until
I get rid of the gang,
then you can have him back
and be on your way.
What about the Rathtars?
Where're you keeping them?
There's one.
What are you going to do?
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Every time.
Han Solo,
you are a dead man.
Bala-Tik.
What's the problem?
The problem is that we
loaned you 50,000 for this job.
Can you see them?
No.
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.
You know you can't
trust those little freaks.
How long we known each other?
- They have blasters.
- A lot of them.
Not long.
We want our money back now.
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap?
I spent that money.
Kanjiklub wants their investment back too.
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
Tell that to Kanjiklub.
Tasu Leech!
Good to see you!
You made another mistake, Solo.
This is your intention.
Boys! You both're gonna
get what I promised.
Have I ever not
deliver for you before?
Yeah.
Twice.
What was the second time?
Your game is old.
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.
You have nowhere to hide.
That BB unit.
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.
And two fugitives.
First time I heard of it.
- Search the freighter.
- On it.
Wait, wait, wait...
If we close the blast doors in that
corridor, we can trap those gangs.
Close the blast doors from here?
Resetting the fuses should do it.
I got a bad feeling about this.
Oh, no.
"Oh no," what?
Wrong fuses.
Kill them!
And take the droid!
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!
How do they look?
They look like that.
- This way.
- Are you sure?
No!
No, no, no.
Finn!
Finn!
REY!
Get out of here!
Rey!
Finn!
Finn!
Get it off me!
Get off!
Get off!
Finn!
It had me!
But the door...
That was lucky.
I got the door.
Cover us!
AAWWW!
Chewie!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Wow.
Come on!
Come on!
- Han
- You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!
Awww!
Hey.
Where're you going?
Unkar Plutt installed
a fuel pump here.
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere..
I hate that guy.
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.
Watch the thrusters.
We're getting out of here in light speed.
From inside of a hanger?
Is that even possible?
I never ask that question
until after I've done it.
This is not how I thought
this day was going to go.
Angle the shield.
Hang on back there!
No problem!
Come on, baby,
don't let me down.
- What?
- Compressor.
Inform the First Order that
Han Solo has the droid they wanted.
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.
The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance,
leading them to the last Jedi.
If Skywalker returns,
the new Jedi will rise.
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility....
General!
Our strategy must now change.
The weapon.
It is ready.
I believe the time
has come to use it.
We shall destroy the government
that supports the Resistance.
The Republic.
Without their friends to protect them,
the Resistance will be vulnerable.
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.
Go,
oversee preparations.
Yes, Supreme Leader.
There has been an awakening.
Have you felt it?
Yes.
There's something more.
The droid we seek is
aboard the Millennium Falcon.
In the hands of your father,
Han Solo.
He means nothing to me.
Even you, Master of the Knights of Ren,
have never faced such a test.
By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.
We shall see.
We shall see.
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.
Coolant's leaking.
Try transferring auxiliary power to...
- secondary tank.
- Secondary tank.
I got it.
Chewie, come on!
I need help with
this giant hairy thing!
- Coming.
- Stop moving!
Ahhh!
- Chewie!
- He needs help.
You hurt Chewie,
you're going to deal with me!
Hurt him?
He almost kill me six times!
Which is fine.
If this hyperdrive blows,
there's going to be pieces
of us in three different systems.
What did you do?
I bypass the compressor.
Huh.
Move, ball.
Don't say that.
You did great, just rest.
Good job, kid.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
So.
Fugitive, huh?
The First Order wants the map.
Finn is with the Resistance.
I'm just a scavenger.
Let's see what you got.
- Should I?
- Go ahead.
This map is not complete,
it's just a piece.
Ever since Luke disappeared
people'd been looking for him.
Why did he leave?
He was training a
new generation of Jedi.
One boy, an apprentice,
turned against him, destroyed it all.
Luke felt responsible.
He just walked away
from everything.
Do you know what happened to him?
A lot of rumors, stories.
People who'd knew him best,
think he went looking for
the first Jedi Temple.
The Jedi were real?
I used to wonder
about that myself.
I thought it was a bunch
of mumbo jumbo.
A magical power holding
together good and evil,
the Dark side and the Light.
The crazy thing is...
It's true.
The Force, the Jedi.
All of it.
It's all true.
No, you rest.
You want my help?
You're getting it.
Going to see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.
This is our stop.
I didn't know there was this
much green in the whole galaxy.
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure
what we're walking into here.
Did you just call me Solo?
Sorry, Han. Mr. Solo.
You should know,
I'm a big deal in the Resistance,
which puts a real target
on my back.
Are there any conspirators here?
Like First Order sympathizers?
Listen, "big deal".
You have another problem.
Women always figure out the truth.
Always.
You might need this.
I think I can handle myself.
I know you do.
That's why I'm giving it to you.
Take it.
You know how to use
one of those?
Yeah.
You pull the trigger.
A little bit more
truer than that.
You got a lot to learn.
You got a name?
Rey.
Rey.
I've been thinking about
bringing on some more crew, Rey.
A second mate.
Someone to help out.
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me, who appreciates the Falcon.
Are you offering me a job?
I wouldn't be nice to you.
I don't pay much.
You're offering me a job?
I'm thinking about it.
Well?
If you are, I'd be flattered.
But I have to go home.
Where?
Jakku?
I've already been away too long.
Chewie, checkout the ship
as best you can.
It's too bad.
Chewie kinda likes you.
Solo, why are we here again?
- To get your droid on a clean ship.
- Clean?
Do you think it was luck that
Chewie and I found the Falcon?
If we can find it on our scanners,
the First Order is not far behind.
You want to get BB-8
to the Resistance.
Maz Kanata is our best bet.
We can trust her, right?
Relax, kid.
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste,
so, let me do the talking.
And whatever you do, don't stare.
- At what?
- At what?
Any of it.
Han Solo!
Oh, boy
Hey, Maz.
Where's my boyfriend?
- Chewie's working in the Falcon.
- I like that Wookiee.
I assume you need something.
Desperately.
Let's get to it.
I'll be back.
Resistance spotted...
and your lost droid is here too.
Inform the First Order...
I found the droid.
Forgive me.
I feel it again.
The pull to the light.
The Supreme Commander senses it.
Show me again.
The power of the darkness.
And I will let nothing
stand in our way.
Show me...
... Grandfather.
And I will finish
what you started.
A map...
to Skywalker himself?
I need you to
get this droid to Leia.
No.
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.
Han.
Go home.
Leia doesn't want to see me.
Please, we came here for your help.
What fight?
The only fight
against the dark side.
Through the ages,
I've seen evil take many forms.
The Sith.
The Empire.
Today, it is the First Order.
Their shadows spreading across the galaxy.
We must face them.
Fight them.
All of us.
There is no fighting
against the First Order.
Not one we can win.
Look around.
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized us already.
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...
What's this?
What are you doing?
Solo, what is she doing?
I don't know,
but it ain't good.
If you live long enough, you see
the same eyes in different people.
I'm looking at the eyes of a man
who wants to run.
You don't know a thing about me.
Where I'm from.
What I've seen.
You don't know the
First Order like I do.
They will slaughter us.
We all need to run.
Hm.
You see those two?
They'll trade work for
transportation to the Outer Rim.
There, you can disappear.
Finn?
Come with me.
What about BB-8?
We're not done yet.
We have to get him
back to your base.
You think?
He can't.
I can't.
Keep it, kid.
Who's the girl?
- What? What is it?
- Let him speak first.
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.
What are you doing?
Don't leave without me.
You can't just go.
I won't let you.
I'm not who you think I am.
- Finn, what are you talking about?
- I'm not Resistance.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a Stormtrooper.
Like all of them, I was taken
from my family I'll never know.
And raised to do one thing.
In my first battle,
I made a choice.
I wasn't going to kill for them.
So I ran,
right into you.
You looked at me
like no one ever had.
I was ashamed of what I was.
But, I'm done with the First Order.
I'm never going back.
Rey, come with me.
Don't go.
Take care of yourself.
Please.
No!
No!
No!
Come back!
No!
Come back!
Come back!
No!
No!
His energy...
No!
Come back!
Quiet, girl.
No!
Rey?
These are your first steps.
What was that?
I shouldn't gone in here.
That lightsaber was Luke's.
And his father's before him.
And now, it call's to you.
I have to get back to Jakku.
Han told me.
Dear child, I see your eyes.
You already know the truth.
Whoever you're waiting for in Jakku.
They're never coming back.
But, there's someone who still could.
Luke.
The belonging you seek
is not behind you,
it is ahead.
I'm no Jedi,
but I know the Force.
It moves through and
surrounds every living thing.
Close your eyes.
Feel it .
The light...
it's always been there.
It will guide you.
The saber.
Take it.
I'm never touching
that thing again.
I don't want any part of this.
Today is the end of the Republic.
The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.
At this very moment
in a system far from here,
the New Republic lies to the galaxy
while secretly supporting the treachery
of the rogues of the Resistance.
This fierce machine
which you have built,
upon which we stand
will bring an end to the Senate,
to their cherished fleet.
All remaining systems will bow
to the First Order!
and will remember this
as the last day of the Republic!
Confirm transfer to manual control.
Configure !
Fire!
Hosnian System
New Republic
Oh.
What is it?
That was New Republic.
The First Order, they've done it.
Where's Rey?
Mistress, are you alright?
What are you doing?
I see you running,
are you alright?
You have to go back.
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
- BB-8...
- No.
No, you can't. You have to go back,
you're too important.
They'll help you.
I had this for ages.
I kept it locked away.
Where'd you get that?
A good question,
for another time.
Take it.
Find your friend!
Those beasts.
They're here.
FN-417, hold position.
Oh, safety.
Wow!
Sir.
The droid was spotted heading west.
With a girl.
You have to keep going,
stay out of sight.
- I'll try to fight them off.
- I hope they wont find us.
I hope so too.
Come on, Chewie!
Rey and BB-8! They need you!
Now! Go!
I need a weapon!
You have one!
Hey.
Can I try that?
I like this thing.
Traitor!
- You okay, "Big deal"?
- Thanks.
Don't move!
TK-338, we have targets in custody.
We have incoming in 28.6.
Move! Move!
Move! Move!
Scramble all squads!
Repeat, scramble all squads!
Take cover and
cover our mid field position!
It's the Resistance.
Go straight ahead at them!
Don't let these thugs scare you!
- Copy that.
- We're with you, Poe.
Quick!
Yeah!
That's one hell of a pilot!
The girl I heard so much about.
The droid.
Where is it?
We're going to need air support.
The map.
You've seen it.
Sir, Resistance fighters.
We need more troops.
Pull the division out.
Forget the droid.
We have what we need.
Fall back!
No!
No!
No, no!
No!
No!
Rey!
He took her.
Did you see it?
He took her.
She's gone.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Come on.
Goodness!
Han Solo!
It is I, C-3PO.
You probably don't recognize me
because of the red arm.
Look who it is!
Did you see who...?
Oh.
Eh.
Excuse me, Princess... General.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, BB-8, they're waiting.
- What an unusual arm you have.
Yes, I must have
my proper arm reinstall.
You changed your hair.
Same jacket.
No, new jacket.
I saw him.
Leia, I saw our son.
He was here.
Hey!
Poe!
BB-8, my friend.
Good to see you.
Finn saved you?
Where is he?
There.
Poe.
Poe Dameron, you're alive?
Why...
- so are you!
- What happened?
What happened, I was throw from the crash.
I woke up at night; no you, no ship, nothing
- BB-8 says that you saved him.
- No, no, no. It wasn't just me.
You completed my mission, Finn...
That's my jacket.
- Oh.
- No no no...
Keep it.
It suits you.
You're a good man, Finn.
Poe, I need your help.
PZ-4CO, report to communications.
General Organa.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
This is Finn.
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.
That was incredibly brave,
what you did.
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.
Han told me about the girl.
I'm sorry.
Finn's familiar with the weapon that
destroyed the Hosnian system,
he worked on the base.
We're just good for
anything you can tell us.
That's where my friend was taken.
I got to get there fast.
And I will do everything
I can to help, but first
you need to tell us
all you know.
That sounds very scary.
You must be so brave.
General, I regret to
inform you but
this map recovered from BB-8
is only partially complete.
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.
We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.
We are so foolish to think I could
find Luke and bring him home.
Leia.
Don't do that.
Do what?
Anything.
Princesses.
I'm trying to be helpful.
When did that ever help?
And don't say the Death Star.
R2, I need your help.
Wake up, R2.
BB-8.
You're wasting your time.
He might have the map.
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the
rest of the map in his backup data.
- Can't we wake him?
- I am afraid not.
R2-D2 has been in low power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.
Sadly, he may never
be his own self again.
Poor R2.
Listen to me, will you?
I know every time you...
Every time you look me,
you're reminded of him.
Do you think
I want to forget him?
I want him back.
There's nothing more
we could have done
There's too much Vader in him.
That's why I wanted him
to be trained with Luke.
I just never should had sent
him away, thats when I lost him.
That's when I lost you both.
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.
I went back to the only thing
I was only good at.
We both did.
We lost our son.
Forever.
No.
It was Snoke.
He seduced our son
to the dark side.
But we can still save him.
Me.
You.
If Luke couldn't reach him,
how could I?
Luke is a Jedi.
You're his father.
There's still light in him,
I know it.
General.
The reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.
Where am I?
You're my guest.
Where are the others?
Do you mean the murderers, traitors
and thieves, you called friends?
You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.
You still want to kill me.
That happens when you're being
haunting by a contort mask.
Tell me about the droid.
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator...
Carrying a section of a navigation chart.
We have the rest.
Recovered from the archives of the Empire,
but we need the last piece.
Yet somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.
You,
a scavenger.
You know I can take
whatever I want.
You're so lonely.
So afraid to leave.
At night, desperate to sleep.
Imagine an ocean.
I see it.
I see the island.
And Han Solo.
You feel like he's a father
you never had.
He would have disappointed you.
Get out of my head!
I know you've seen the map.
It's in there.
And now you'll give it to me.
Don't be afraid.
I feel it too.
I'm not giving you anything.
We'll see.
You...
you're afraid...
that you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader!
This scavenger
resisted you!
She is strong with the Force.
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.
And the droid?
Ren believed it was
no longer valuable to us.
That the girl,
is all we needed.
As a result, the Droid is most likely been
returned to the hands of the enemy.
They may have the map already.
Then the Resistance must be destroyed
before they get to Skywalker.
We have their location.
We tracked their reconnaissance
team to the Ileenium System.
Good.
Then we will crash them
once and for all.
Prepare the weapon.
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.
I just need your guidance.
If what you say
about this girl is true...
Bring her to me.
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell
with the door open.
What did you say?
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell
with the door open.
I will tighten those restraints,
scavenger scum!
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell
with the door open.
I will remove these restraints
and leave this cell
with the door open.
And you'll drop your gun.
And I'll drop my gun.
No.
Guards!
Guards!
Begin charging the weapon.
Yes, sir.
Weapon charging.
The scan Data from Snap's reconnaissance
flight confirms Finn's report.
They somehow created a hyper lightspeed
weapon built within the planet itself.
A laser cannon?
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.
It's another Death Star.
I wish that were the case, Major.
This was the Death Star.
And this,
is Starkiller base.
So, it's big.
How is it possible to power up
a weapon of that size?
They uses the power of the sun.
As the weapon is charge,
the sun is drained until it disappears.
Ma'am.
The First Order charging
their weapon again, now.
Our system is the next charge.
Oh, my.
Without the Republic fleet, we're doom.
Okay.
How do we blow it up?
- There is always a way to do that.
- Han's right.
In order for that amount
of power to be contained,
that base has to have some kind
of thermal oscillator.
There is one.
Precinct 47.
Here.
If we can destroy that oscillator,
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.
Maybe the planet.
We'll go in there, we'll hit that
oscillator with everything we got.
They have defensive shields that
our ships cannot penetrate.
We disable the shields.
Kid, you worked there.
- What do you got?
- I can do it.
I like this guy.
I can seal the shields, but I have
to be there, on the planet.
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?
If I told you,
you wouldn't like it
So, we disable the shields,
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up the big gun.
Alright, let's go!
Chewie, check that thermal capitator.
Come on, let's go!
Hey, be careful with those.
They're explosives.
Now, you tell me?
You know?
No matter how much we fought,
I always hated watching you leave.
That's why I did it
So you'd miss me.
I did miss you.
It wasn't all bad, was it?
Huh?
Some of it was... good.
Pretty good.
Some things never change.
True.
You still drive me crazy.
If you see our son,
bring him home.
Sir. Sensors triggered in Hanger 718.
We're searching the area.
She's just beginning
to test her powers.
The longer it takes to find her,
the more dangerous she becomes.
How're we getting in?
Their shields have a
fractional refresh rate.
It keeps anything traveling slower
than lightspeed from getting through.
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?
Chewie, get ready.
And... Now!
I am pulling up!
I get any higher, they'll see us!
Sir, she was not found in hanger 718,
but all troops are on alert.
Put every hanger on lockdown.
She's going to try to
steal a ship to escape.
Han Solo.
The flooding tunnel
is over that ridge.
We'll get in that way.
What was your job when
you were based here?
Sanitation.
Sanitation?
And how do you know
how to disable the shields?
I don't.
I'm just here to get Rey.
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.
Solo, we'll figure it out.
We'll use the force.
That's not how the Force works.
I'm cold.
Oh, really?
You're cold?
Come on.
Report.
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.
Hey!
The longer we're here,
the less luck we're going to have.
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.
AH!
- Do you remember me?
- FN-2187
Not any more. The name's Finn
and I'm in charge.
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Okay.
Follow me.
You want me to blast that bucket
off your head? Lower the shields.
You're making a big mistake.
Do it.
Solo, if this works, we're not going
to have a lot of time to find Rey.
Don't worry, kid.
We won't leave here without her.
You can't be so stupid
just to think this will be easy.
My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.
I disagree.
What do we do with her?
Is there a garage chute?
Trash compactor?
There is.
General, their shields are down.
Thank the maker!
Han did it!
Send them in.
Give Poe full authorization for attack.
Black leader,
go to sublight speed formation.
Roger, base.
Red squad, Blue squad,
take my lead.
Dropping out of lightspeed.
Almost in range!
Hit the target dead center
as many runs as we can get.
Approaching target.
Fighters incoming!
Shields up!
Shields up!
Dispatch all squadrons.
Yes, General.
Alright, let's light it up!
Ha!
Direct hit!
But no damage.
Yeah, we got to keep hitting it.
Another bombing run.
Remember, when the sun is gone,
their weapon will be ready to fire.
But as long as there is light,
we got a chance.
- Master Poe, enemy fighters!
- Guys, we got a lot of company!
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.
I'm going in and draw fire
but I'm going to need you to cover.
You sure you are up for this?
Hell, no.
I'll go in and try to find Rey.
The troopers will be on our tail.
We have to be ready for that.
Oh, there's an access tunnel
that leads...
Why're you do that? Hm.
Why're you doing this?
I'm trying to
come up with a plan.
- Ah!
- No!
Are you alright?
- Yeah.
- Good.
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?
- Finn, what are you doing here?
- We came to get you.
What did he say?
He says it was your idea.
Thank you.
How did you get away?
I can't explain it.
And you wouldn't believe it.
Escape now,
hug later
I got one behind me.
- You see it?
- Yeah. I'm on it.
Watch out for ground fire.
They're in trouble.
We can't leave.
My friend's got a bag
full of explosives.
Let's use them.
General, are you seeing this?
Two more X-wing's down.
That's half our fleet destroyed.
And their weapon will be
fully charged in 10 minutes.
It would take a miracle
to save us now.
That girl knows her stuff.
Let's set the charges
against every other column.
You're right.
That's a better idea.
You take the top.
I'll go down below.
Detonator.
We'll meet back here.
Find them.
Ben!
Han Solo.
I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.
Take off that mask.
You don't need it.
What do you think
you'll see if I do?
The face of my son.
Your son is gone.
He was weak and foolish
like his father,
so I destroyed him.
That's what Snoke
wants you to believe,
but it's not true.
My son is alive.
No.
The Supreme Leader is wise.
Snoke is using you
for your power.
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.
You know it's true.
It's too late.
No, it's not.
Leave here with me. Come home.
We miss you.
I'm being torn apart.
I want to be free
of this pain.
I know what I have to
do but I don't know
if I have the strength to do it.
Will you help me?
Yes.
Anything.
(The light!)
NO!!!
Thank you.
The oscillator's been damaged,
but it's still functional.
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.
The Falcon's this way.
We not done yet.
You're a monster!
It's just us now.
Han Solo can't save you.
Rey!
Hold on.
Rey. Rey.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no. Rey.
Traitor!
That lightsaber...
belongs to me.
Come and get it.
We just lost Star-1.
We are overwhelmed.
What are we doing?
It isn't working.
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.
Looks like our friends got in.
Red-4, Red-6, Cover us.
- I'm on it.
- Roger.
Everybody else, get your target on.
Give it everything you got.
I need some help here.
I need some help!
- Coming in.
- Watch out!
I'm hit!
All teams.
I'm going in.
Pull up and cover me.
Copy that, Black leader.
Good luck, Poe.
The weapon will be fully
charged in 30 seconds.
Prepare to fire.
You need a teacher!
I can show you
the ways to the Force!
The Force.
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!
Just look! We won't survive,
even Hux is gone!
Supreme Leader.
The fuel cells erupted.
The collapse of the
planet has begun.
Leave the base at once and
come to me with Kylo Ren.
It's time to complete his training.
Finn. Finn!
Finn.
(Chewie.)
All teams,
I got eyes on them.
Yes!
Our job's done here.
Let's go home.
Easy. Easy.
He's hurt.
We got a heartbeat.
How are you?
You are awake!
R2-D2!
You've come back!
You found what?
How dare you call me that!
We have to find Master Luke.
- Find Master Luke, how?
- I have a map.
Come, R2, we must go
tell the others at once!
General.
Excuse me, General.
R2-D2 may contain some
much needed good news.
Tell me.
Poe, I need your map.
Yeah?
Alright, buddy, hold on.
Ha!
The map, it is complete.
Luke.
Oh, my dear friend,
how I missed you.
We'll see each other again.
I believe that.
Thank you, my friend.
Rey.
May the Force be with you.

- Captain.
- Yes, sir?
Tell them we wish
to board at once.
With all due respect...
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.
Yes, of course.
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.
I'm TC-14 at your service.
This way, please.
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.
Make yourselves comfortable.
My master
will be with you shortly.
I have a bad feeling about this.
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.
It's something elsewhere, elusive.
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.
But not at the expense
of the moment.
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.
Yes, Master.
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?
These Federation types are cowards.
The negotiations will be short.
What? What did you say?
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.
I knew it.
They're here to force a settlement.
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.
Are you brain-dead?
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.
Send a droid.
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.
What is it?
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.
The blockade is fnished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.
My lord, is that legal?
I will make it legal.
And the Jedi?
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.
Kill them immediately.
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.
Captain, look!
Shields...
Sorry.
Dioxis.
They must be dead by now.
Destroy what's left of them.
Oh! Excuse me.
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.
Uh-oh. Blast them.
What is going on down there?
We lost the transmission, sir.
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.
I want droidekas
up here at once!
We will not survive this.
Close the blast doors!
That will hold them.
They are still coming through.
This is impossible!
Where are those droidekas?
Master! Destroyers!
They have shield generators!
It's a standoff.
Let's go.
They're no match for droidekas.
Sir!
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.
Let's split up.
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.
You were right
about one thing, Master.
The negotiations were short.
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.
It's Queen Amidala herself.
At last we are getting results.
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.
I was not aware of such failure.
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.
You must be mistaken.
Beware, Viceroy.
The Federation
has gone too far this time.
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.
You assume too much.
We will see.
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?
How could that be true?
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.
It must... handiwork...
negotiate... ambassadors...
- nobody would...
- Senator Palpatine.
What's happening?
Check the transmission generator.
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: Invasion.
The Federation
would not dare go that far.
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be fnished.
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.
Our security volunteers
will be no match...
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...
and there is no trace of theJedi.
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.
If they're down here, sir,
we'll fnd them.
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!
Get down!
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?
I spake.
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!
You saved my again.
- What's this?
- A local.
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.
More?
"More" did you spake?
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.
- A city?
- Uh-huh.
Can you take us there?
On second thought, no.
- Not really, no.
- No?
'Tis embarrassing...
but my afraid
my've been banished.
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.
- You hear that?
- Yah.
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.
If they fnd us,
they will crush us...
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.
Oh.
Yousa point is well seen.
Dis way. Hurry!
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?
Ah, my warning you.
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?
So good bein home!
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.
Mesa back.
Noah gain, Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.
Yousa in big dudu dis time.
How wude.
Yousa cannot bees hair.
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.
Day tink day brains so big.
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.
Mesa no tink so.
Day not know of uss-en.
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.
Then speed us on our way.
Wesa ganna speed yous away.
We could use a transport.
Wesa give yousa una bongo.
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...
'tis goen through the planet core.
Now...
go.
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.
Master, what's a bongo?
A transport, I hope.
Deysa setten yousa up.
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.
Any help here would be hot.
Master, we're short on time.
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.
This Gungan may be of help.
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?
Hisen to be pune-ished.
I saved his life.
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt."
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.
Binks...
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?
Begone wit him!
Count me outta dis one.
Better dead here
than dead in da core.
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfsh!
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?
Yud-say boom da gasser...
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.
Big gooberfsh!
Huge-o teeth!
- There's always a bigger fsh.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.
Queen Amidala is young and naive.
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.
Yes, my lord.
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.
Oh, maxi big, da Force.
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!
Wesa dyin' here.
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?
Power's back.
Monster's back!
Relax.
You overdid it.
Head for that outcropping.
Oh, boy.
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.
Ah, victory.
Dis'n loverly.
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.
I have assurances
it will be ratifed by the senate.
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.
Process them.
Captain, take them to Camp 4.
Roger, roger.
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.
Get their weapons.
Yousa guys bombad!
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.
The negotiations
never took place.
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.
They've knocked out
all our communications.
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.
They can't afford to kill her.
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.
We are brave, Your Highness.
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.
Be careful, Governor.
We'll need to free those pilots.
I'll deal with that.
Halt.
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.
Come on. Move!
Go!
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.
Hello, boyos.
There's the blockade.
The shield generator's been hit!
How wude!
We're losing droids fast.
If we can't get the shield generator
fxed, we'll be sitting ducks.
The shields are gone.
The power's back!
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.
Deflector shields up at maximum.
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.
Here, Master.
Tatooine.
It's small, out of the way, poor.
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.
How can you be sure?
It's controlled by the Hutts.
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than landing...
on a system controlled
by the Federation...
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...
which gives us the advantage.
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?
She has disappeared, my lord.
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.
I want that treaty signed.
My lord...
it's impossible to locate the ship.
It's out of our range.
Not for a Sith.
This is my apprentice...
Darth Maul.
He will find your lost ship.
This is getting out of hand.
Now there are two of them.
We should not
have made this bargain.
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.
It is to be commended.
What is its number?
R2-D2, Your Highness.
Thank you, R2-D2.
Padm.
Clean this droid up
as best you can.
It deserves our gratitude.
Continue, Captain.
Your Highness,
with your permission...
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.
Hello.
Sorry. Husa are yousa?
I'm Padm.
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.
You're a Gungan, aren't you?
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow...
mesa here.
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.
Don't let them send
any transmissions.
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.
Wait!
Wait.
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.
The queen wishes it.
She's curious about the planet.
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.
Moisture farms,
for the most part.
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.
The few spaceports like this one...
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.
Like us.
Dissen berry, berry bad.
Icky, icky goo!
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.
Good day to you.
What do you want?
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.
Boy, get in here now!
My droid has a readout of what I need.
What took you so long?
I was cleaning the fan switches.
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.
So, let me take thee out back, huh?
We'll fnd what you need.
Don't touch anything.
- Are you an angel?
- What?
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.
How long have you been here?
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.
You're a slave?
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.
- I got ya.
- Hey!
Hit the nose.
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.
Saying of which...
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
Republic credits?
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fne.
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fne.
No, they won't!
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.
No money, no parts, no deal.
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.
We're leaving. Jar Jar.
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.
I was glad to meet you too.
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.
They seemed nice to me.
Clean the racks.
Then you can go home.
Yippee!
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?
A few containers of supplies.
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...
not in the amount
you're talking about.
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.
I'll check back later.
Noah gain. Noah gain.
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.
Are you going to pay for that?
It costs seven wupiupi.
Oops.
Is this yours?
Who, mesa...
Careful, Sebulba.
He's a big-time outlander.
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.
- Hi.
- Hi there.
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.
He picked a fght with a Dug...
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.
Thanks, my young friend.
But mesa doen nutten!
This storm will slow them down.
Looks pretty bad.
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.
We'll be right there.
Here, you'll like these pallies.
- Here.
- Thank you.
My bones are aching.
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.
Mom!
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
Isn't he great?
He's not fnished yet.
He's wonderful.
You really like him?
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.
Where is everybody?
Whoops.
Oh, hello.
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.
How might I serve you?
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?
My parts are showing?
My goodness!
The death toll is catastrophic.
We must bow to their wishes.
You must contact me.
It's a trick.
Send no reply.
Send no transmissions of any kind.
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?
Either way,
we're running out of time.
Tatooine is sparsely populated.
If the trace was correct,
I will fnd them quickly, Master.
Move against the Jedi frst.
You will then have no diffculty
in taking the queen to Naboo...
to sign the treaty.
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.
At last we will have revenge.
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.
They will be no match for you.
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!
How wude!
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.
The Republic's antislavery laws...
The Republic doesn't exist out here.
We must survive on our own.
Xcuse me.
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?
They have Podracing
on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.
I'm the only human who can do it.
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.
Don't do that again.
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.
I don't think so.
No one can kill a Jedi.
I wish that were so.
I had a dream I was a Jedi.
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...
on a very important mission.
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.
I can help.
I can fx anything.
I believe you can.
But frst we must acquire
the parts we need.
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.
Podracing.
Greed can be a powerful ally.
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.
You could enter my pod.
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.
You could make him think
it was yours...
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.
But, Mom, I love it.
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.
Anakin.
Your mother's right.
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?
No.
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.
We'll fnd some other way.
There is no other way.
I may not like it,
but he can help you.
He was meant to help you.
Are you sure about this?
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?
The queen will not approve.
The queen doesn't need to know.
Well, I don't approve.
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.
My ship will be the entry fee.
Not bad!
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.
What would the boy ride?
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fx it.
It wasn't my fault.
Really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.
I actually saved the pod, mostly.
That you did.
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.
The fastest ever built.
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...
and I supply the boy.
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?
If it's going to be 50-50...
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.
If we win...
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.
Either way, you win.
Deal!
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.
What if this plan fails, Master?
We could be stuck here
a very long time.
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.
And...
there's something about this boy.
You should be very proud of your son.
He gives without any thought
of reward.
He knows nothing of greed.
He has...
He has special powers.
Yes.
He can see things
before they happen.
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.
It's a Jedi trait.
He deserves better
than a slave's life.
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identifed him early.
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.
Who was his father?
There was no father.
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.
I can't explain what happened.
Can you help him?
I don't know.
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.
Wow, a real astro droid!
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?
With this?
You're such a joker, Ani.
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.
Keep away from
those energy binders.
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.
Okay.
My tongue is fat.
My tongue... Wrench.
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.
I'm stuck.
You know, I fnd that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.
My mouth.
Ani, I'm stuck.
My tongue is fat.
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.
Thank you.
Go.
It's working!
It's working!
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?
Most of them.
Has anyone been to 'em all?
Not likely.
I wanna be the frst one
to see 'em all.
Ani, bedtime!
There we are.
Good as new.
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.
Go on.
You have a big day tomorrow.
Sleep well, Ani.
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.
Wait a minute.
I need a midi-chlorian count.
The reading is off the chart.
Over 20,000.
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.
No Jedi has.
What does that mean?
I'm not sure.
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.
Patience, my blue friend.
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.
And we'll be far away from here.
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?
I warn you, no funny business.
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.
I have great faith in the boy.
He's a credit to your race...
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.
Oh, no!
Why do you think that?
He always wins!
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.
- I'll take that bet.
- What?
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...
the boy and his mother.
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.
The boy, then.
We'll let fate decide, huh?
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.
Blue, it's the boy.
Red...
his mother.
You won this small toss,
outlander...
but you won't win the race!
So it makes little difference!
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.
Good morning.
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.
Do what?
Finish the race, of course.
You've never won a race?
Well, not exactly.
Not even fnished?
Kitster's right.
I will this time.
Of course you will.
That's absolutely right.
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.
Two-time winner Boles Roor.
Sebulba!
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...
Mawhonic!
A hearty hello...
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.
And hoping for a big win today...
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...
a local boy.
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.
Be safe.
I will, Mom. I promise.
You won't walk away from this one...
you slave scum.
Don't count on it, slime ball.
You're bantha fodder!
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.
Right.
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.
I will.
May the Force be with you.
Jabba the Hutt.
Welcome.
Begin the race!
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.
- Is he nervous?
- He's fne.
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.
You should too.
You assume too much.
Start your engines.
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!
Oh, no!
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.
Come on, Ani!
And there goes Skywalker!
Go, Ani, go!
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...
on the canyon dune turn.
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.
Oh, no!
Where is Master Anakin?
Look. Here he comes.
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.
Yay! Yippee!
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!
Here he comes!
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...
followed closely by Skywalker!
Go, Ani!
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!
It's Skywalker!
Sebulba!
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!
Did he crash-ed?
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!
He's catching Sebulba!
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!
That little human being
is out of his mind!
They're side by side!
- Yippee!
- Yay!
I can't believe it.
The crowds are going nuts!
Yay, Ani!
Mom, I did it! Yay!
Good going, Ani!
We owe you everything, Ani.
It's so wonderful, Ani.
You have brought hope
to those who have none.
I'm so very proud of you.
You!
You swindled me.
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.
I lost everything.
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?
I'm sure they can settle this.
Take him.
Hidoe!
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.
I'm going back.
Some unfnished business.
I won't be long.
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.
Come on. Hup!
Hey. These are yours.
Yes!
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.
- And he has been freed.
- What?
You're no longer a slave.
Did you hear that?
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.
You are free.
Will you take him with you?
Is he to become a Jedi?
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.
Nothing happens by accident.
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?
Anakin...
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.
Can I go, Mom?
Anakin...
this path has been placed
before you.
The choice is yours alone.
I wanna do it.
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.
What about Mom?
Is she free too?
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.
It is time for you to let go.
I don't want things to change.
But you can't stop the change...
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.
I love you.
Now hurry.
Thank you.
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.
Will you be all right?
Yeah.
Hello, Master Anakin.
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...
and I'm going away in a starship.
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to fnish you, 3PO...
give you coverings and all.
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.
Sell me?
Bye.
Oh, my.
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.
Will I ever see you again?
What does your heart tell you?
I hope so.
Yes.
I guess.
Then we will
see each other again.
I will come back
and free you, Mom.
I promise.
Now, be brave...
and don't look back.
Don't look back.
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!
Go!
Tell them to take off!
Qui-Gon's in trouble.
Take off.
Over there. Fly low.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
What was it?
I'm not sure...
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.
My guess is
it was after the queen.
What are we gonna do about it?
We shall be patient.
Anakin Skywalker...
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...
and you, Governor,
are going to die...
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.
This invasion
will gain you nothing.
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.
Take him away.
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...
for these rumoured
underwater villages.
They will not
stay hidden for long.
The death toll is catastrophic.
We must bow to their wishes.
You must contact me.
You all right?
It's very cold.
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.
A little too warm
for my taste.
Space is cold.
You seem sad.
The queen is worried.
Her people are suffering, dying.
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...
I'm not sure what'll happen.
I made this for you...
so you'd remember me.
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.
It'll bring you good fortune.
It's beautiful.
But I don't need this
to remember you by.
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...
but my caring for you will remain.
I care for you, too, only l...
Miss your mother.
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
Welcome, Your Highness.
It's an honour to fnally
meet you in person.
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.
There is a question
of procedure...
but I'm confdent
we can overcome it.
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.
The situation has become
much more complicated.
Ani, come on.
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.
Pitty hot.
There is no civility,
only politics.
The Republic
is not what it once was.
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.
There is no interest
in the common good.
I must be frank, Your Majesty.
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.
If I may say so, Your Majesty...
the chancellor
has little real power.
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...
one who could control
the bureaucrats...
and give us justice.
You could call for a vote of
no confdence in Chancellor Valorum.
He has been
our strongest supporter.
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.
Our people are dying, Senator.
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.
To be realistic, Your Majesty...
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...
for the time being.
That is something I cannot do.
He was trained in the Jedi arts.
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.
Impossible.
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.
Hard to see,
the dark side is.
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.
May the Force be with you.
Master Qui-Gon.
More to say have you?
With your permission, my master...
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.
A vergence, you say.
Located around a person?
A boy.
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...
I have seen in a life-form.
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.
You believe it's this boy?
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.
Revealed your opinion is.
I request the boy be tested,
Master.
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?
Finding him
was the will of the Force.
I have no doubt of that.
Bring him before us, then.
The boy's here to see Padm.
Let him in.
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padm's
not here right now.
Who is it?
Anakin Skywalker to see Padm,
Your Highness.
I've sent Padm on an errand.
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...
to start my training, I hope.
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.
Thank you, Your Highness.
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...
a tragedy has occurred...
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.
This is outrageous!
I object
to the senator's statements.
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...
who speaks on our behalf.
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...
I object!
There is no proof!
This is incredible.
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.
The Congress of Malastare...
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.
A commission must be appointed.
- The point...
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
Enter the bureaucrat.
The true rulers of the Republic.
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.
The point is conceded.
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...
to explore the validity
of your accusations?
I will not defer.
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.
If this body
is not capable of action...
I suggest new leadership is needed.
I move for a vote
of no confdence...
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
Vote now! Vote now!
Order!
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...
a strong chancellor...
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.
They will not go along
with you this time.
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.
A ship.
A cup.
A ship.
A speeder.
How feel you?
Cold, sir.
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.
See through you we can.
Be mindful of your feelings.
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
I miss her.
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?
What has that got to do
with anything?
Everything.
Fear is the path to the dark side.
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.
Hate leads to suffering.
I sense much fear in you.
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?
I don't know.
Gungans get pasted too, eh?
I hope not.
Gungans no die'n without a fght.
Wesa warriors.
Wesa got a grand army.
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.
Your Highness?
Your Highness...
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...
as supreme chancellor.
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.
Who else has been nominated?
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
I feel confdent our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.
I will be chancellor.
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.
Senator, this is your arena.
I feel I must return to mine.
I've decided to go back to Naboo.
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.
I will sign no treaty, Senator.
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.
- Captain.
- Your Highness.
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.
Stay here where it's safe.
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.
The Force is strong with him.
He is to be trained, then?
No, he will not be trained.
No?
He is too old.
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.
Clouded this boy's future is.
I will train him, then.
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.
Impossible to take on a second.
The code forbids it.
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...
but he is capable.
There is little more
he can learn from me.
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.
Now is not the time for this.
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.
And draw out the queen's attacker.
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.
This is the clue we need...
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.
May the Force be with you.
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.
From your point of view.
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.
The council will decide
Anakin's future.
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.
You won't be, Ani.
I'm not allowed to train you...
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.
Always remember:
Your focus determines your reality.
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.
Master, sir...
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...
that resides
within all living cells.
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.
They continually speak to us...
telling us the will of the Force.
When you learn
to quiet your mind...
you'll hear them speaking to you.
I don't understand.
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.
I welcome your help.
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.
Wesa goin' home!
Come on, R2.
Is the planet secure?
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.
We are in complete control
of the planet now.
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...
things stay as they are.
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.
Yes, my lord.
A Sith here?
Those are the forward stabilizers.
And those two control the pitch?
You catch on pretty quick.
As soon as we land...
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.
I agree.
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.
I will take back what's ours.
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.
We have no army.
And I can only protect you.
I can't fght a war for you.
Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa, Your Highness?
Yes. I need your help.
I have one battleship on my scope.
It's a droid control ship.
They've probably spotted us.
We haven't much time.
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.
Good.
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.
And we cannot use our power
to help her.
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.
Desa nobody dare!
The Gungan city is deserted!
Some kinda fght, mesa tinks.
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?
More likely they were wiped out.
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.
Jar Jar Binks.
Who's da uss-en uthers?
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.
I come before you in peace.
Ah, Naboo biggen.
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.
Yousa all bombad.
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.
Your Honour.
Whosa dis?
I am Queen Amidala.
This is my decoy...
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.
I ask you to help us.
No, I beg you to help us.
We are your humble servants.
Our fate is in your hands.
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?
Mesa lika dis!
Maybe...
wesa...
being friends.
We've sent our patrols.
We already located
their starship in the swamp.
It won't be long, my lord.
This is
an unexpected move for her.
It's too aggressive.
Lord Maul, be mindful.
Let them make the first move.
Yes, my master.
Deysa comin!
All right!
They're here!
Good. They made it.
Yousa doen grand.
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.
Oh, no, no, no.
So, wesa make you...
bombad general.
General?
Captain.
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?
Almost everyone's in camps.
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...
and much stronger.
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.
The battle is a diversion.
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.
R2.
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.
Once we get
to the main entrance...
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.
What do you think, Master Jedi?
The viceroy will be well-guarded.
The diffculty is getting
into the throne room.
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.
Wesa ready to do our-san part.
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.
We will send
what pilots we have...
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.
The weapons on your fghters
may not penetrate the shields.
There's an even bigger danger.
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...
he will return
with another droid army.
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.
Everything depends on it.
She is more foolish
than I thought.
We are sending all troops...
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.
It appears to be made up
of primitives.
This will work to our advantage.
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?
Wipe them out.
All of them.
Halt!
Starting up the shield.
Open fre.
Once we get inside, you fnd
a safe place to hide and stay there.
- Sure.
- Stay there.
Roger, roger.
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.
This is too close.
Ani, fnd cover.
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!
Fighters straight ahead.
Roger, Bravo Leader.
Roger, Bravo Leader.
Cease fre.
Steady. Steady.
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.
Ouch time.
Fire!
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.
Red group! Blue group!
Everybody, this way!
Hey, wait for me!
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.
- But l...
- Stay in that cockpit.
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.
We gotta do something, R2.
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.
Nope. Wait. Here it is.
Nope. Wait. Here it is.
Yeah!
Let's go!
It's on automatic pilot.
Try to override it.
We don't have time for this,
Captain.
Look, there they are.
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.
Dumb droid. Take that!
Get off! Get off! Get off!
Get off!
The deflector shield
is too strong.
This is tense!
R2, get us off this autopilot.
It's gonna get us both killed.
You did it, R2!
Let's go left.
Go back?
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.
Go!
Ascension guns!
Retreat! Retreat!
Dis is nutsen.
Uh-oh. Big boomers.
Give me a lift!
Jar Jar, usen da booma!
What?
Mesa no have a booma!
Here. Taken dis one.
Jar Jar!
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.
We're hit, R2!
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!
Everything's overheated.
Oops. This is not good.
No giben up, General Jar Jar.
Mesa think of something.
Hands up.
My give up. My give up.
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...
this pointless debate in the senate.
Viceroy!
Your occupation here has ended.
After her.
This one's a decoy.
Captain!
Jam the doors.
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.
Take this!
And this!
- Oops.
- We're losing power.
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.
Impossible!
Nothing can get through our shield.
Let's get outta here.
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!
We didn't hit it.
Now, this is Podracing.
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!
What the...
Was'n they doing?
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!
They all broke-ed.
No, it's too late.
- No.
- Obi-Wan.
Promise...
Promise me
you will train the boy.
Yes, Master.
He is the chosen one.
He will bring balance.
Train him.
Now, Viceroy...
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
And you, young Skywalker.
We will watch your career
with great interest.
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.
It's you who should be
congratulated.
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...
I do not.
Qui-Gon believed in him.
The chosen one the boy may be.
Nevertheless...
grave danger I fear
in his training.
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.
I will train Anakin.
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.
Qui-Gon's defance
I sense in you.
Need that you do not.
Agree with you the council does.
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.
What will happen to me now?
The council have granted me
permission to train you.
You will be a Jedi, I promise.
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.
Always two there are.
No more, no less.
A master and an apprentice.
But which was destroyed?
The master or the apprentice?
Hidoe, everybody!
Peace!

Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.
Very good, Lieutenant.
[ Droid Beeping ]
[ Grunts ]
We made it.
[ Man ]
I guess I was wrong.
There was no danger at all.
Cord.
Milady, I'm so sorry.
I've failed you, Senator.
No.
Milady, you're still
in danger here.
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.
You did your duty.
Cord did hers. Now, come.
Senator Amidala,
please.
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.
- If they do break away--
- I will not let this Republic...
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.
My negotiations
will not fail.
If they do,you must realize
there aren't enoughJedi
to protect the Republic.
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.
Master Yoda.
Do you think it will
really come to war?
Hmm, the dark side
clouds everything.
Impossible to see
the future is.
[ Speaking Huttese ]
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.
- Good.
- [ Huttese ]
Send them in.
We will discuss
this matter later.
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform--
terrible.
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.
But for certain,
Senator...
in grave danger you are.
MasterJedi,
may I suggest...
the senator
be placed...
under the protection
of your graces.
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--
The situation
is that serious?
No, but I do, Senator.
I realize all too well
that additional security...
might be
disruptive for you...
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.
An old friend,
like Master Kenobi.
That's possible.
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.
Do it for me, milady.
Please?
The thought
of losing you...
is unbearable.
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.
[ Senator Amidala ]
Thank you, Master Windu.
You seem
a little on edge.
- Not at all.
- I haven't felt you this tense...
since we fell into
that nest of gundarks.
[ Scoffs ] You fell into
that nightmare, Master...
and I rescued you,
remember?
Oh... yes.
[ Laughing ]
[ Chuckles ]
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.
Obi? Obi!
Mesa so smilen
to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again,JarJar.
- Senator Padm.
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.
Desa Jedi arriven.
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.
Ani? My goodness,
you've grown.
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.
Well, f-for a senator,
I mean.
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.
I don't need more security.
I need answers.
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padm.
- I promise you.
- We will not exceed our mandate...
my young Padawan learner.
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master.
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?
What?
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?
Protection is a job
for local security, notJedi.
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.
And you will learn
your place, young one.
Perhaps with
merely your presence...
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.
Now, if you'll
excuse me...
I will retire.
I know I'll feel better
having you here.
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor, and I'll be in
the control center downstairs.
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.
She hardly even
recognized me,JarJar.
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...
she's forgotten me completely.
Shesa happy. Happier den
mesa seein her in a longo time.
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.
She was pleased to see us.
Now, let's check the security.
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.
Be careful.
They're very poisonous.
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.
No assassin would try that way.
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.
- [ Beeping ]
- What's going on?
Ah, she covered
the cameras.
I don't think
she liked me watching her.
What is she thinking?
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.
[ Obi-Wan ] There are many
other ways to kill a senator.
[ Anakin ] I know, but we also want to
catch this assassin, don't we, Master?
You're using her as bait.
It was her idea.
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.
I can sense everything
going on in that room.
Trust me.
It's too risky.
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.
And yours are?
Possibly.
You look tired.
I don't sleep well anymore.
Because of your mother?
I don't know why
I keep dreaming about her.
Dreams pass in time.
I'd much rather dream
about Padm.
Just being around her again
is... intoxicating.
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.
You've made
a commitment to theJedi order,
a commitment not easily broken.
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.
[ Anakin ] She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.
[ Obi-Wan ] It is my experience
that senators...
focus only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...
-in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.
At least not on
the economics of politics.
[ R2-D2 Beeps ]
[ Beeping ]
And besides,
you're generalizing.
- The chancellor doesn't
appear to be corrupt.
- Palpatine is a politician.
[ Obi-Wan ] I have observed
that he is very clever...
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.
I think he's a good man. My--
I sense it too.
[ Gasps ]
[ Whirring ]
Stay here!
Are you all right,
milady?
Ah!
- [ Horn Honking ]
- What the--
[ Cursing In Huttese ]
Jedi poo doo!
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.
- I couldn't find a speeder
that I really liked...
- There he is.
with the open cockpit and
the right speed capabilities.
If you spent as much time
practicing your saber techniques
as you do your wit...
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.
- I thought I already did.
- Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.
- Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!
- [ Laughing ]
- You know I don't like it
when you do that.
- Sorry, Master.
I forgot you
don't like flying.
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide.
Anakin! How many times
have I told you-- Ah!--
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
- stay away from power couplings!
That was good!
Where are you going?
He went that way.
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...
that creep is gonna
end up deep-fried...
and, personally, I'd very much
like to find out who he is
and who he's working for.
This is a shortcut.
I think.
Well, you've lost him.
I'm deeply sorry, Master.
That was some shortcut,
Anakin.
He went completely
the other way.
- Once again you've proved--
- If you'll excuse me.
I hate it when he does that.
[ Grunting ]
- [ Engine Accelerating ]
- [ Grunting ]
[ Shouting, Grunting ]
[ Onlookers Murmuring ]
Anakin!
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.
Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.
I try, Master.
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?
Don't say that, Master. You're
the closest thing I have to a father.
- Then why don't you listen to me?
- I am trying.
[ Cheering, Shouting ]
- Can you see him?
- I think he is a she...
and I think she
is a changeling.
In that case,
be extra careful.
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?
For a drink.
Thank you.
You wanna buy
some death sticks?
You don't want to
sell me death sticks.
- I don't want to sell you death sticks.
- You want to go home...
- and rethink your life.
- I want to go home and rethink my life.
- [ Patron Shouting In Huttese ]
- [ Patrons Laughing ]
[ Cheering ]
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Patrons Gasping ]
[ Moaning, Grunting ]
Easy.Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.
- [ Groaning ]
- Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?
[ Moans ]
It was a senator from Naboo.
And who hired you?
It was just a job.
Who hired you? Tell us.
Tell us now!
It was a bounty hunter called--
[ Gagging ]
Wee shahnit... sleemo.
Toxic dart.
[ Yoda ] Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.
What about
Senator Amidala?
She will still
need protecting.
Handle that your Padawan will.
Anakin, escort the senator back
to her home planet of Naboo.
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.
Travel as refugees.
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.
Until caught
this killer is...
our judgment she must respect.
- Hmm.
-[ Windu ] Anakin, go to the senate...
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.
I will talk with her. Senator Amidala
will not refuse an executive order.
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.
Thank you,
Your Excellency.
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.
Your patience
has paid off.
Your guidance
more than my patience.
You don't
need guidance, Anakin.
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.
Then you will be invincible.
I have said it many times: You are
the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.
Thank you,
Your Excellency.
I see you becoming
the greatest of all theJedi, Anakin...
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.
I am concerned
for my Padawan.
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.
[ Yoda ] The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.
[ Windu ]
The boy has exceptional skills.
But he still has
much to learn, Master.
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.
Yes, yes.
A flaw more and more
common among Jedi.
Hmm.
Too sure of themselves
they are.
Even the older,
more experienced ones.
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...
your apprentice is the only one who
can bring the Force back into balance.
[ Padm ] I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.
- Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.
- Hmm?
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.
Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility
and, uh--
JarJar, I don't wish
to hold you up.
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.
Of course.
Milady.
I do not like
this idea of hiding.
Don't worry.
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.
I haven't worked for a year to defeat
the Military Creation Act...
to not be here when
its fate is decided.
Sometimes we must let go of our pride
and do what is requested of us.
Anakin,
you've grown up.
Master Obi-Wan
manages not to see it.
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.
As wise as Master Yoda and...
as powerful as Master Windu.
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.
In some ways--
a lot of ways--
I'm really ahead of him.
I'm ready for the trials...
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.
He won't let me move on.
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.
He's overly critical.
He never listens.
He-- He doesn't understand.
It's not fair!
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.
It's the only way we grow.
[ Sighs ]
I know.
Anakin.
Don't try to grow up too fast.
But I am grown up.
You said it yourself.
Please don't look
at me like that.
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.
Sorry, milady.
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.
Take good care of Dorm.
The threat's on you two now.
He'll be safe with me.
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.
I worry about you. What if they
realize you've left the capital?
Well, then myJedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.
Anakin.
Don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.
Yes, Master.
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.
You'll be back here
in no time.
I'll be most grateful for
your speed, MasterJedi.
- It's time to go.
- I know.
Anakin, may the Force
be with you.
May the Force
be with you, Master.
Suddenly I'm afraid.
This is my first assignment
on my own. I am too.
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Beeping ]
I do hope he doesn't
try anything foolish.
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.
Someone to see ya, honey!
Jedi, by the looks of him.
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
Hey, old buddy!
[ Both Laughing ]
Ohhh.
[ Coughs ]
So, my friend,
what can I do for ya?
You can tell me
what this is.
Well, whattaya know!
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...
on Subterrel,
beyond the outer rim.
[ Obi-Wan ] Can you tell me
where it came from? Thank you.
[ Dex ] This baby
belongs to them cloners.
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.
It's these funny little cuts
on the side that give it away.
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols. Huh!
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...
for the difference
between knowledge and...
[ Laughing ]
wisdom.
Well, if droids could think,
there'd be none of us here, would there?
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?
No, no. It's beyond
the outer rim.
I'd say about,
uh, 1 2 parsecs...
outside the Rishi Maze.
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.
[ Chuckles ]
These, uh, Kaminoans
keep to themselves.
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Oh, depends.
Depends on what, Dex?
On how good
your manners are...
and how big your, uh...
pocketbook is.
[ Chuckling ]
Hmm.
Did you call
for assistance?
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Are you having
a problem, Master Kenobi?
Yes, um, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.
- Kamino.
- It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...
just south
of the Rishi Maze.
[ Beeping ]
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...
doesn't exist.
Impossible. Perhaps the archives
are incomplete.
If an item does not appear
in our records...
it does not exist.
- Hey, you! No droids!
- [ Beeping ]
- Get outta here!
- [ Raspberries ]
- [ Beeping ]
- Thank you, R2.
- [ Chirping ]
- Must be difficult, having
sworn your life to theJedi...
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.
Or be with the people
that I love.
Are you allowed to love?
I thought that was
forbidden for a Jedi.
Attachment is forbidden.
Possession is forbidden.
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...
is central
to a Jedi's life.
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.
- You've changed so much.
- Ah, you haven't changed a bit.
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.
[ Yoda ] Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.
Use your feelings
you must.
Younglings.
Younglings!
A visitor
we have.
[ Together]
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.
Hello. I'm sorry
to disturb you, Master.
What help can I be,
Obi-Wan? Hmm?
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.
I trust him, but the systems
don't show on the archive maps.
Mmm. Lost a planet
Master Obi-Wan has.
- How embarrassing.
-[ Children Giggling ]
How embarrassing.
Hmm?
Liam, the shades.
Gather round
the map reader.
Clear your minds...
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.
It ought to be... here...
but it isn't.
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.
Hmm. Gravity's
silhouette remains...
but the star
and all the planets...
disappeared they have.
How can this be?
Hmm? A thought?
-[ Yoda ] Anyone.
-[ Boy ] Master?
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.
[ Yoda Chuckles ]
Truly wonderful
the mind of a child is.
[ Chuckling ]
The Padawan is right.
Go to the center
of gravity's pull...
and find your planet
you will.
Hmm. The data
must have been erased.
But, Master Yoda, who could
empty information from the archives?
That's impossible, isn't it?
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.
But who and why,
harder to answer.
Meditate on this I will. Hmm.
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.
I'm not sure
I was ready.
The people you served
thought you did a good job.
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution
so you could stay in office.
I was relieved when
my two terms were up.
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...
I couldn't refuse her.
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.
I'm glad that you
chose to serve.
[ Padm ] If the senate
votes to create an army...
- I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.
- [ Man ] It's unthinkable.
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.
Do you see any way
through negotiations...
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?
Not if they feel threatened.
My guess is they'll turn
to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.
It's outrageous, but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.
Let's pray that day
never comes.
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.
What is your suggestion,
MasterJedi?
Oh, Anakin's
not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking--
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.
I think it would be wise
if you took advantage of
my knowledge in this instance.
Sorry, milady.
[ Queen Jamillia ]
Perfect. It's settled, then.
There it is, R4, right where it
should be. Our missing planet Kamino.
[ Whistling, Beeping ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
MasterJedi.
The prime minister
is expecting you.
- I'm expected?
- Of course.
He is anxious
to meet you.
After all these years...
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.
Now, please, this way.
May I present Lama Su...
prime minister of Kamino.
And this is MasterJedi--
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.
Please.
And now to business.
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.
are ready...
with a million more
well on the way.
That's good news.
Please tell
your Master Sifo-Dyas...
that his order
will be met on time.
I'm sorry. Master--
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of theJedi Council...
is he not?
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.
- The army?
- Yes.
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.
Tell me, Prime Minister...
when my master
first contacted you about the army...
did-- did he say
who it was for?
Of course he did.
This army
is for the Republic.
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.
That's why I'm here.
We used to come here
for school retreat.
We would swim
to that island every day.
I love the water.
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.
I don't like sand.
It's coarse and rough
and irritating...
and it gets everywhere.
Not like here.
Here, everything is soft...
and smooth.
No.
[ Gasps ]
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.
[ Lama Su ]
Clones can think creatively.
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.
This group was created
about five years ago.
[ Obi-Wan ] You mentioned
growth acceleration.
[ Lama Su ]
Oh,yes, it's essential.
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.
Now we can do it
in half the time.
[ Obi-Wan ]
I see.
[ Lama Su ]
They are totally obedient...
taking any order
without question.
We modified
their genetic structure...
to make them less independent
than the original host.
And who was
the original host?
A bounty hunter
called Jango Fett.
And where is
this bounty hunter now?
Oh, we keep him here.
[ Lama Su ] Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...
Fett demanded
only one thing:
an unaltered clone
for himself.
- Curious, isn't it?
- ''Unaltered''?
[ Lama Su ]
Pure genetic replication.
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...
and no growth acceleration.
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.
Magnificent, aren't they?
- I don't know.
- [ Chuckles ]
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.
You gonna use one of
yourJedi mind tricks on me?
They only work
on the weak-minded.
All right.
I was 1 2.
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.
All right, I get the picture.
Whatever happened to him?
I went into public service;
he went on to become an artist.
- Maybe he was the smart one.
- You really don't like politicians,
do you?
I like two or three...
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.
[ Both Chuckle ]
I don't think
the system works.
How would you
have it work?
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.
That's exactly
what we do.
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.
Well, then they
should be made to.
- By whom? Who's gonna make them? You?
- I don't know. Someone.
- Of course not me.
- But someone.
Someone wise.
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.
Well, if it works.
- You're making fun of me.
- No.
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.
[ Creature Bellowing ]
[ Anakin ]
Whoa, whoa!
[ Laughing ]
- [ Bellowing ]
- Oh, whoa! [ Grunting ]
- [ Lowing ]
- [ Grunts, Groans ]
Ani! Ani, are you all right?
[ Laughing ]
[ Both Laughing ]
[ Beeping ]
Boba, is your father here?
Boba, is your father here?
Yep.
May we see him?
Sure.
Dad, Taun We's here.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
Jango, welcome back.
Was your trip productive?
Fairly.
This is Jedi Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
He's come to check
on our progress.
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.
I'm just a simple man
trying to make my way in the universe.
Ever made your way as far into
the interior as Coruscant?
- Once or twice.
- Recently?
Possibly.
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.
Uh, Boba,
rood eht so-heeck.
Master who?
[ Obi-Wan ]
Sifo-Dyas.
Is he not theJedi
who hired you for this job?
Never heard of him.
Really?
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.
Curious.
Do you like your army?
I look forward
to seeing them in action.
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.
Thank you for
your time,Jango.
Always a pleasure
to meet a Jedi.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
What is it, Dad?
Pack your things.
We're leaving.
And when I got to them, we went into
aggressive negotiations. Thank you.
''Aggressive negotiations''?
What's that?
Uh, well, negotiations
with a lightsaber.
- [ Laughing ] Oh.
- [ Laughing ]
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.
From the moment
I met you...
all those years ago...
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.
And now that
I'm with you again...
I'm in agony.
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.
The thought of
not being with you--
I can't breathe.
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.
My heart is beating...
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.
You are in my very soul...
tormenting me.
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.
I can't.
We can't.
It's...just not possible.
Anything is possible, Padm.
Listen to me.
No, you listen.
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm-- I'm a senator.
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.
Then you do feel something.
I will not let you
give up your future for me.
You are asking me
to be rational.
That is something
I know I cannot do.
Believe me, I wish that I could
just wish away my feelings...
but I can't.
I will not give in to this.
Well, you know, it...
wouldn't have to
be that way.
We could keep it a secret.
We'd be living a lie...
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.
I couldn't do that.
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?
No. You're right.
It would destroy us.
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.
And remind them,
if they need more troops...
it will take more time
to grow them.
- I won't forget, and thank you.
- Thank you.
- R4!
- [ Beeping ]
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!
[ Beeping ]
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...
is the assassin
we are looking for.
Do you think these cloners
are involved in the plot
to assassinate Senator Amidala?
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.
[ Yoda ] Do not assume
anything, Obi-Wan.
Clear your mind must be...
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.
Yes, Master.
They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army...
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?
No. Whoever placed that order
did not have the authorization
of theJedi Council.
Bring him here.
Question him we will.
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...
we could not see.
[ Sighs ]
I think it is time
we informed the senate...
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.
If informed the senate is...
multiply our adversaries will.
No.
No.
Mom, no.
Don't. No.
No.
Don't go.
I don't want to disturb you.
Your presence is soothing.
You had another nightmare
last night.
Jedi don't have nightmares.
I heard you.
I saw my mother.
She is suffering, Padm.
I saw her as clearly
as I see you now.
[ Deep Sigh ]
She is in pain.
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...
but I have to go.
I have to help her.
I'll go with you.
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
Dad, look!
Boba, get on board!
- [Jango Shouts ]
- Oh, not good. [ Grunts ]
[ Driver Speaking Huttese ]
- Wait right there.
- Okey-okey.
Da wanga!
Chut-chut, Watto.
[ Speaking Huttese ]
Let me help you with that.
What? What do you want?
Wait! You're a Jedi!
[ Grunts ]
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Ai!
[ Grunts, Sighs ]
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
- [ Fly Buzzing ]
- Ani?
Little Ani?
Nahhh.
You are Ani! It is you!
[ Laughing ]
You sure sprouted, huh?
Wee-hoo!
AJedi! Whattaya know!
[ Chuckles ]
Hey... maybe you could
help with some deadbeats
who owe me a lot of money.
My mother.
Oh, yeah. Shmi.
Uh... she's not mine-a
no more-a. I sold her.
- You sold her?
- Years ago.
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business, huh?
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, I sold her to
a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars.
At least I think
it was Lars.
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!
Can ya beat that, eh?
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
Do you know
where they are now?
Ooh, long way
from here.
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think, mmm.
I'd like to know.
Eh, sure. Absolutely!
[ Chuckles ] Let's go
look at my records, huh?
[ Chuckles ]
Mmm.
- [ Beeping ]
- Dad!
I think we're being tracked!
[Jango ] He must have put
a homing device on our hull.
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.
[ Cackling ]
[ Beeping ]
Seismic charges!
Stand by.
[ Beeping ]
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.
Watch out!
- [ Rapid Beeping ]
- Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!
Oh, blast!
This is why I hate flying!
- We got him!
- We'll just have to finish him.
- R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.
- [ Beeping ]
- Fire them now!
- [ Beeping ]
- Well, we won't be seeing him again.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.
- [ Beeping ]
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.
[ R4 Beeps ]
[ Beeping ]
- [ R2-D2 Whistles, Beeps ]
- [ Padm ] Stay with the ship, R2.
[ Beeping ]
Oh! Um, uh, hello.
How might I be of service?
I am C--
- 3PO?
- Oh, um--
The maker!
Oh, Master Ani!
I knew you would return.
I knew it!
And Miss Padm. Oh, my.
Hello, 3PO.
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.
I've come to see my mother.
Oh. Um, I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.
I'm Anakin Skywalker.
Owen Lars. Uh, this is
my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.
- I'm Padm.
I guess
I'm your stepbrother.
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.
- Is my mother here?
- No, she's not.
Cliegg Lars.
Shmi is my wife.
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.
[ Cliegg ] It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.
A hunting party
of Tusken Raiders.
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...
when they took her.
[ Sighs ]
Those Tuskens walk like men...
but they're vicious,
mindless monsters.
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...
I just couldn't ride anymore
un-until I heal.
I don't want
to give up on her...
but she's been gone a month.
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.
Where are you going?
To find my mother.
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.
You're gonna have to stay here.
These are good people, Padm.
You'll be safe.
Anakin--
I won't be long.
[ Machinery Clanging ]
[ Man #1 ] We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.
What about the senator
from Naboo?
Is she dead yet?
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.
[ Man #1 ]
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.
[ Alien ] With these new battle droids
we've built for you...
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.
[ Man #1 ]
As I explained to you earlier...
I am quite convinced
that 1 0,000 more systems...
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.
[ Speaking In Alien Language ]
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.
The Techno Union army...
[ Electronic Warbling ]
is at your disposal, Count.
The Banking Clan
will sign your treaty.
[ Man #1 ]
Good. Very good.
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.
TheJedi
will be overwhelmed.
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.
[ Growling ]
[ Snarling ]
[ Growling, Snarling

[ Growling ]
[ Moaning ]
Mom.
Mom? Mom?
Ani?
Ani? Is it you?
I'm here, Mom.
You're safe.
Ani?
Ani?
Oh, you look
so handsome.
My son.
Oh, my grown-up son.
I'm so proud of you, Ani.
I missed you.
Now I am complete.
I love y--
Stay with me, Mom.
Everything--
I love--
I-- I love--
[ Groaning ]
[ Shouting ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Qui-GonJinn's Voice ]
Anakin! Anakin! No-o-o!
What is it?
Pain, suffering...
death I feel.
Something terrible
has happened.
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?
- [ Beeping ]
- We'll have to try something else.
[ Beeping ]
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo. It's much closer.
Anakin?
Anakin, do you copy?
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Anakin?
He's not on Naboo, R4.
[ Beeping ]
I'm going to try
and widen the range.
I do hope nothing's
happened to him.
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...
but it's coming
from Tatooine.
What in the blazes
is he doing there?
I told him to stay on Naboo.
[ Beeping ]
We haven't got
much time.
Anakin?
Anakin, do you copy?
- This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
- [ Creature Screeching ]
[ Static,
Obi-Wan's Voice Breaks Up ]
Retransmit this message--
[ Garbled Audio ]
Anakin, do you copy?
Anakin--
My long-range-- [ Static ]
has been knocked out.
- Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
- [ Beeping ]
I brought you something.
Are you hungry?
The shifter broke.
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.
But I couldn't--
Why'd she have to die?
Why couldn't I save her?
I know I could have!
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!
Someday I will be.
I will be
the most powerfulJedi ever!
I promise you.
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.
Anakin.
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!
- [ Object Clattering ]
- [ Sniffling ]
What's wrong, Ani?
I--
I killed them.
I killed them all.
They're dead.
Every single one of them.
And not just the men...
but the women...
and the children too.
They're like animals,
and I slaughtered them like animals!
I hate them!
[ Anakin Exhales ]
To be angry
is to be human.
I'm a Jedi.
I know I'm better than this.
[ Cliegg ] I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.
Good-bye, my darling wife.
And thank you.
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.
I wasn't strong enough.
But I promise
I won't fail again.
I miss you...
so much.
[ Beeping ]
R2? What are you
doing here?
[ Beeping ]
It seems that he is carrying a message
from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Hmm. Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?
[ Beeping ]
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...
to the droid foundries
on Geonosis.
The Trade Federation is to take
delivery of a droid army here...
and it is clear
that Viceroy Gunray...
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming a--
Wait. Wait.
- [ Lightsaber Whooshing ]
- [ Obi-Wan Grunting ]
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.
I agree.
Anakin, we will deal
with Count Dooku.
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.
Protect the senator
at all costs.
That is your first priority.
Understood, Master.
They'll never get there
in time to save him.
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.
Geonosis is
less than a parsec away.
If he's still alive.
Ani, are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?
- He's your friend, your mentor. He's--
- He's like my father!
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.
- If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.
- [ Engines Power Up ]
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.
[ Palpatine ] Count Dooku
must have made a treaty with them.
[ Speaking In Alien Language ]
The debate is over.
Now we need that clone army.
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.
The senate will never approve the use
of clones before the separatists attack.
This is a crisis.
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.
He can then approve
the creation of an army.
But what senator would have the courage
to propose such a radical amendment?
If only...
Senator Amidala were here.
Mm.
[ Screeching ]
[ Grumbling ]
Traitor.
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.
They have gone too far.
This is madness.
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.
Well, I hope it doesn't take
too long. I have work to do.
May I ask why a Jedi knight...
is all the way out here
on Geonosis?
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.
Do you know him?
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.
The Geonosians
don't trust them.
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.
It's a great pity that our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.
I wish he were still alive.
I could use his help right now.
Qui-Gon Jinn
would never join you.
Don't be so sure,
my young Jedi.
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...
just as you
were once his.
He knew all about
the corruption in the senate...
but he would never have
gone along with it if he had
learned the truth as I have.
- The truth?
- The truth.
What if I told you
that the Republic...
was now under the control
of the dark lord of the Sith?
No, that's not possible.
TheJedi would be aware of it.
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...
of a Sith lord
called Darth Sidious.
I don't believe you.
The viceroy
of the Trade Federation...
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.
You must join me, Obi-Wan...
and together
we will destroy the Sith!
I will never join you, Dooku.
It may be difficult
to secure your release.
[JarJar ] It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...
wesa desa
Federation du Trade.
Senators, ''dellow felagates''.:
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...
mesa propose
that the senate...
give immediately
emergency powers...
to the supreme chancellor.
[ Shouts Of Approval ]
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!
[ Shouting In Alien Language ]
[ Senate Chairman ]
Order! We shall have order!
It is with great reluctance...
that I have agreed
to this calling.
- I love democracy.
I love the Republic.
- [ Applause ]
The power you give me...
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.
[ Cheering, Applause ]
And as my first act
with this new authority...
I will create a grand army
of the Republic...
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.
It is done, then.
Hmm.
I will take whatJedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.
Visit I will
the cloners on Kamino, hmm...
and see this army they have
created for the Republic.
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?
They're exhaust vents
of some type.
That'll do.
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.
As a member
of the senate...
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.
Don't worry. I've given up
trying to argue with you.
[ Whistling, Beeping ]
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...
they would have
asked for it, hmm?
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.
[ Beeping ]
- [ Beeping ]
- For a mechanic...
you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.
- [ Beeping ]
- I am programmed
to understand humans!
[ Beeping ]
''What does that mean?'' Oh!
- That means I am in charge here!
- [ Raspberries ]
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?
Oh! Idiot!
- Please wait.
- [ Beeping ]
Do you know
where you're going?
Wait.
[ Squawking ]
Oh, my--
Oh, oh, oh!
- [ Screaming ]
- Padm!
Ah!
[ Grunts ]
Oh, my goodness!
Shut me down!
Machines making machines.
Huh! How perverse.
[ Grunts ] Oh!
Calm down, R2.
I almost fell.
You'll get your chance--
Oh! I'm scrap.
[ Grunting ]
It's a nightmare!
Oh, I want to go home! Ahh!
Oh, what did I do
to deserve this?
[ Beeping ]
[ Whistling ]
- [ Padm Grunting ]
- [ Geonosian Screeching ]
Ahhh!
- [ Whistling ]
- Hmm. I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.
He's always getting himself
into trouble. Oops.
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
Oh!
Oh, I'm so confused.
Oh, not again.
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.
Don't move,Jedi!
Take him away.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid to die.
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.
What are you talking about?
I love you.
You love me?
I thought that we had decided
not to fall in love...
that we would be forced
to live a lie...
and that it would
destroy our lives.
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.
I truly...
deeply love you...
and before we die,
I want you to know.
Eeyah!
[ Loud Cheering ]
[ Cheering ]
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.
I retransmitted it just as
you had requested, Master.
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.
Good job.
[ Cheering ]
[ Speaking In Geonosian ]
Settle down. Settle down.
[ Cheering Subsides ]
[ Speaking In Geonosian ]
Let the executions begin.

Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.
Master Windu,
how pleasant of you to join us.
This party's over.
Brave but, uh, foolish,
my old Jedi friend.
- You're impossibly outnumbered.
- [ Scoffs ] I don't think so.
- We'll see.
- [ Heavy Footsteps Approaching ]
[ Synthesized Voice ]
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.
[ C-3PO ]
What's all this noise?
A-A battle!
Oh, there's been

I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!
- [ Roaring ]
- [ Obi-Wan Grunts ]
[ Roaring ]
[ Groaning, Yelling ]
[ Yowling ]
Die,Jedi dogs!
Oh! What did I say?
Hah!
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
Ohh!
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.
You call this
a diplomatic solution?
No, I call it
aggressive negotiations.
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.
[ Growling, Screeching ]
[ Creature Shrieking ]
- [ Beeping ]
- R2, what are you doing here?
[ Beeping ]
What are you doing?
Oh, stop that!
You're going to strain
something. My neck!
- Now where are you taking me?
Oh, this is such a drag.
- [ Beeping ]
[ C-3PO ]
Oh, I'm quite beside myself.
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!
- [ Beeping ]
- Yes, but is my head on straight?
[ Dooku ] Master Windu,
you have fought gallantly...
worthy of recognition
in the archives of theJedi order.
Now it is finished.
Surrender,
and your lives will be spared.
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!
Then, I'm sorry, old friend.
Look!
Look!
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.
[ Beeping, Chirping ]
Oh, I've had
the most peculiar dream.
If Dooku escapes...
rally more systems
to his cause he will.
Hold on!
Aim right above
the fuel cells!
Good call,
my young Padawan.
[ Viceroy Gunray ]
TheJedi have amassed a huge army.
That doesn't seem possible.
How could theJedi
come up with an army so quickly?
We must send all available droids
into battle.
There are too many.
[ Speaking In Geonosian ]
Our communications have been jammed.
- Pilot, land in that assembly area!
- Yes, sir.
Sir, I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.
To the forward
command center take me.
Attack those Federation starships!
Quickly!
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.
Very good.
Very good.
[ Viceroy Gunray ]
This is not looking good at all!
We must get the starships
back into space.
[ Speaking In Geonosian ]
We have to order a retreat.
My master
will never allow the Republic...
to get away
with this treachery.
[ Speaking In Geonosian ]
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.
TheJedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.
[ Geonosian ]
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.
They will be much safer there
with my master.
[ Alarm Blaring ]
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.
Yes, sir.
Move all quadrants
to sector 5-1 -5.
Look over there!
It's Dooku!
Shoot him down!
We're out of rockets, sir.
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!
[ Beeping ]
- [ Padm Yells ]
- [ Anakin ] Padm!
- Put the ship down!
- Anakin!
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way! Follow that speeder!
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!
You will be expelled
from theJedi order!
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!
What do you think Padm would do
were she in your position?
She would do her duty.
Hmm.
The droid army
is in full retreat.
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.
[ Anakin ] You're gonna pay for all
theJedi that you killed today, Dooku.
- We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.
- I'm taking him now!
No, Anakin! No! No!
[ Anakin Screams ]
As you see, myJedi powers
are far beyond yours.
Now... back down.
I don't think so.
Master Kenobi,
you disappoint me.
Yoda holds you
in such high esteem.
Surely you can do better.
[ Moaning ]
[ Groaning ]
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.
- We'd better get back to
the forward command center.
- No. No.
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.
- Get a transport. Hurry!
- Right away.
[ Moaning ]
Ah! Ahh!
[ Anakin Shouts ]
Brave of you, boy.
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.
- I am a slow learner.
- Anakin!
[ Grunting ]
- Master Yoda.
- Count Dooku.
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.
[ Growling ]
Powerful you have become,
Dooku.
The dark side I sense in you.
I've become more powerful
than anyJedi.
Even you.
Much to learn you still have.
It is obvious that
this contest cannot be decided
by our knowledge of the Force...
but by our skills
with a lightsaber.
[ Yelling ]
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.
This is just the beginning.
[ Speaking In
Droid Language ]
[ Panting, Moaning ]
[ Sighing ]
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Obi-Wan Groans ]
[ Padm ]
Anakin!
The Force is with us,
Master Sidious.
Welcome home,
Lord Tyranus.
You have done well.
I have good news
for you, my lord.
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.
Everything is going
as planned.
[ Obi-Wan ] Do you believe
what Count Dooku said...
about Sidious
controlling the senate?
It doesn't feel right.
Joined the dark side
Dooku has.
Mmm. Lies, deceit...
creating mistrust
are his ways now.
[ Windu ] Nevertheless, I feel we
should keep a closer eye on the senate.
I agree.
Where is your apprentice?
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.
I have to admit that
without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.
[ Yoda ]
Victory?
Victory, you say?
Master Obi-Wan,
not victory.
The shroud of the dark side
has fallen.
Begun the Clone War has.

Lock on to him, R2.
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-
the one crawling
with vulture droids.
I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.
Set S-foils in attack position.
This is where the fun begins.
Let them pass between us.
They're all over me.
- Get them off my-
- I'm gonna go help them out.
No. They are doing theirjob
so we can do ours.
Missiles. Pull up.
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.
All right, R4. No, no.
Nothing too fancy.
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.
We got 'em, R2.
Flying is for droids.
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them.
Buzz droids.
R4, be careful. You have a-
Oh, dear.
They're shutting down
all the controls.
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.
The mission.
Get to the command ship.
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.
In the name of-
- Hold your fre! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.
They're all over me. Anakin!
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.
Get him, R2.
Watch out.
R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.
Have you noticed
the shields are still up?
Sorry, Master.
I have a bad feeling about this.
There they are. Get them.
R2, locate the chancellor.
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there-
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.
I sense Count Dooku.
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?
Spring the trap.
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.
What's the situation, Captain?
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.
Just as Count Dooku predicted.
Destroyers.
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.
Those are Jedi fghters all right.
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?
There's more than
one way out of here.
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31174.
- Come in, R2.
- What that?
R2, do you copy?
R2, activate
the elevator number 31174.
Get back to work. That nothin'.
Activate the elevator 31174.
R2-
Always on the move.
R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?
R2?
R2! R2!
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.
Hands up, Jedi.
R2, do you copy?
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.
Hey, you!
That's better.
You stupid little astro droid.
Oh, it's you.
My eyes! My eyes!
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been-
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?
Count Dooku.
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.
Your swords, please.
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.
I've been looking forward to this.
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.
Get-
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.
You have hate.
You have anger.
But you don't use them.
Good, Anakin. Good.
Kill him.
Kill him now.
I shouldn't.
Do it.
You did well, Anakin.
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.
It wasn't the frst time, Anakin.
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.
Anakin, there's no time.
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.
His fate will be the same as ours.
Prepare for attack!
All batteries, fre! Fire!
Elevator's not working.
R2, activate elevator 3224.
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.
Magnetize! Magnetize!
Fire the emergency booster engines.
We're levelling out, sir.
Easy. We're in a bit
of a situation here.
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.
- What is that?
- Oops.
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.
Too late. Jump!
Let's see if we can fnd something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.
R2, get down here.
R2, do you copy?
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.
Activate ray shields.
Ray shields.
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.
Apparently not.
- I say patience.
- Patience?
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...
and then he'll release
the ray shields.
See? No problem.
Don't move.
Do you have a plan B?
Ah, yes.
The negotiator.
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.
Excuse me.
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.
And-
Anakin Skywalker.
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.
Jedi scum.
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.
Your lightsabres will make
a fne addition to my collection.
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.
R2.
Crush them!
Make them suffer!
Come. Now!
Stay at your stations!
Get him! Get him!
Run!
Don't bother with them.
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.
You lose, General Kenobi.
Get out of here! Run!
Time to abandon ship.
All the escape pods
have been launched.
Grievous.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.
Strap yourselves in.
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fns.
We lost something.
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.
Now we're really picking up speed.
Eight plus 60.
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.
Steady.
Easy, R2.
Fire ships on the left and the right.
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.
Another happy landing.
Coming, Master?
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...
carrying me unconscious
on your back.
All because of your training.
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.
Ninth time.
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefng.
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.
And I assure you...
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.
Then the Jedi Council will make
fnding Grievous our highest priority.
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.
Thank you, Senator Organa.
It couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.
Now there I agree with you.
In fact, I could do with
a tune-up myself.
But the fghting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.
I will do everything
I can in the senate.
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
I've missed you, Padm.
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.
I'm all right.
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.
Anakin, don't say things like that.
Are you all right?
You're trembling.
What's going on?
Something wonderful has happened.
Ani, I'm pregnant.
That's wonderful.
What are we gonna do?
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?
This is a happy moment.
The happiest moment of my life.
Yes, Lord Sidious?
General Grievous...
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.
It will be done, my lord.
The end of the war is near, General.
But the loss of Count Dooku-
His death was a necessary loss.
Soon I will have a new apprentice-
one far younger
and more powerful.
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...
where we can be safe.
I can go early
and fx up the baby's room.
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.
You are so... beautiful.
It's only because I'm so in love.
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.
So love has blinded you?
That's not exactly what I meant.
But it's probably true.
Anakin, help me!
What's bothering you?
Nothing.
I remember when
I gave this to you.
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?
- It was a dream.
- Bad?
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.
And?
And it was about you.
Tell me.
It was only a dream.
You die in childbirth.
And the baby?
I don't know.
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.
This baby will change our lives.
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-
I know. I know.
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?
We don't need his help.
Our baby is a blessing.
Premonitions?
Premonitions.
These visions you have-
They're of pain, suffering.
Death.
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?
Someone.
Close to you?
Yes.
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.
Attachment leads to jealousy.
The shadow of greed that is.
What must I do, Master Yoda?
Train yourself to let go...
of everything you fear to lose.
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.
I'm sorry. I was held up.
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
What's wrong, then?
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.
Be careful of what?
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?
He would not say.
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?
All of this is unusual.
And it's making me feel uneasy.
I hope you trust me, Anakin.
Of course.
I need your help, son.
What do you mean?
I'm depending on you.
For what? I don't understand.
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.
Me?
A master?
I'm overwhelmed, sir.
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.
I think they will.
They need you.
More than you know.
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.
I understand.
You are on this council...
but we do not grant you
the rank of master.
What?
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.
It's unfair.
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me, Master.
We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...
but have found no sign
of General Grievous.
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.
The outlying systems you must sweep.
We do not have
many ships to spare.
What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees?
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.
Go I will.
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
May the Force be with us all.
What kind of nonsense is this?
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honour.
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.
But it's what you wanted.
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.
That has nothing to do with this.
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...
is because
the chancellor trusts you.
And?
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.
What situation?
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.
They want to know what he's up to.
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?
This assignment
is not to be on record.
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.
That is why you must help us.
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...
who has managed to stay in offce
long after his term has expired.
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?
The council is asking you.
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.
It's very dangerous,
putting them together.
I don't think the boy can handle it.
I don't trust him.
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?
So the prophecy says.
A prophecy that misread
could have been.
He will not let me down.
He never has.
I hope right you are.
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?
What do you mean?
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fghting to destroy?
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.
This war represents a failure to listen.
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.
Please, ask him to stop the fghting
and let diplomacy resume.
Don't ask me to do that.
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.
Hold me.
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.
No politics, no plotting, no war.
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.
Come closer. I have good news.
Our clone intelligence units...
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.
He's hiding in the Utapau system.
At last.
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.
You're the best choice, by far.
Sit down.
Leave us.
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.
I'm not sure I understand.
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.
They're planning to betray me.
- I don't think that-
- Anakin.
Search your feelings.
You know, don't you?
I know they don't trust you.
Or the senate.
Or the Republic.
Or democracy, for that matter.
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.
Why?
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
They asked you to spy on me,
didn't they?
I don't know what to say.
Remember back
to your early teachings.
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.
Good is a point of view, Anakin.
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...
including their quest
for greater power.
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.
They think inwards-
only about themselves.
And the Jedi don't?
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.
It's a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...
so powerful and so wise...
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...
to create... life.
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...
from dying.
He could actually...
save people from death?
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...
some consider to be unnatural.
What happened to him?
He became so powerful...
the only thing he was afraid of was...
Iosing his power.
Which eventually, of course, he did.
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.
It's ironic.
He could save others from death...
but not himself.
Is it possible to learn this power?
Not from a Jedi.
All Red units, over here!
Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?
A partial message was intercepted...
in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.
Act on this we must.
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.
Quickly and decisively
we should proceed.
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...
not the chancellor.
A master is needed,
with more experience.
I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.
I agree.
Aye.
Aye.
Very well. Council adjourned.
The droids have started up
their main power generators.
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.
Charge!
Head for cover!
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.
However, it may turn out
Just to be a wild bantha chase.
Master.
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.
I have taught you
everything I know.
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.
But be patient, Anakin.
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.
Goodbye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.
On the far side.
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.
Save your energy.
I can't.
Don't give up, Padm.
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
He came by this morning.
What did he want?
He's worried about you.
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.
I feel lost.
Lost? What do you mean?
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.
They trust you with their lives.
Something's happening.
I'm not the Jedi I should be.
I want more.
And I know I shouldn't.
You expect too much of yourself.
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?
From my nightmares.
Is that what's bothering you?
I won't lose you, Padm.
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.
Greetings, young Jedi.
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?
Unfortunately, the war.
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.
He is here.
We are being held hostage.
- They are watching us.
- I understand.
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.
Tell your people to take shelter.
If you have warriors, now is the time.
Take the fghter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.
It is a volcanic planet.
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.
Your ship is waiting.
Hello there.
General Kenobi.
You are a bold one.
Kill him.
Back away.
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.
Your move.
You fool.
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
Attack, Kenobi.
Army or not...
you must realize
you are doomed.
I don't think so.
Cover that corner.
Master Windu, may I interrupt?
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...
and we have begun our attack.
Thank you, Commander.
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.
Yes, Master.
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.
If he does not give up
his emergency powers...
after the destruction of Grievous...
then he should be
removed from office.
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.
Great care we must take.
Chancellor.
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.
He has engaged General Grievous.
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.
I should be there with him.
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?
I wish I knew.
More and more I get
the feeling that...
I'm being excluded
from the council.
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.
They don't trust you, Anakin.
They see your future.
They know your power
will be too strong to control.
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.
How do you know
the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.
Even the nature of the dark side.
You know the dark side?
If one is to understand
the great mystery...
one must study all its aspects...
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...
you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...
and you will be able to
save your wife...
from certain death.
What did you say?
Use my knowledge. I beg you.
You're the Sith lord.
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.
A life of signifcance...
of conscience.
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.
I know you would.
I can feel your anger.
It gives you focus...
makes you stronger.
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.
Of course. You should.
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.
You have great wisdom, Anakin.
Know the power of the dark side.
Power to save Padm.
So uncivilized.
Master Windu,
I must talk to you.
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.
We're on our way to make sure...
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.
A Sith lord?
Yes. The one we've been looking for.
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.
He's been trained
to use the dark side.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
Then our worst fears
have been realized.
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.
There is much fear
that clouds your judgement.
- I must go, Master.
- No.
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.
But for now, remain here.
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.
Yes, Master.
You do know, don't you...
if theJedi destroy me...
any chance of saving her
will be lost.
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...
you're under arrest, Chancellor.
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?
The senate will decide your fate.
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.
It's treason then.
You are under arrest, my lord.
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.
The Jedi are taking over.
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.
You have lost.
You will die!
He's a traitor!
He is the traitor!
I have the power
to save the one you love.
You must choose.
Don't listen to him, Anakin!
Don't let him kill me.
I can't hold it any longer.
I can't. I'm weak.
I'm too weak.
Help me. Help me!
I can't hold on any longer.
I am going to end this
once and for all.
You can't.
He must stand trial.
He has control of
the senate and the courts.
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.
I'm too weak.
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.
He must live.
- Please don't.
- I need him.
Please don't!
Power!
Unlimited power!
What have I done?
You're fulflling your destiny, Anakin.
Become my apprentice.
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.
I will do whatever you ask.
Good.
Just help me save Padm's life.
I can't live without her.
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...
but if we work together...
I know we can discover the secret.
I pledge myself...
to your teachings.
Good.
Good.
The Force is strong with you.
A powerful Sith you will become.
Henceforth you shall be known as...
Darth... Vader.
Thank you, my master.
Rise.
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.
I agree.
The council's next move
will be against the senate.
Every single Jedi...
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...
is now an enemy of the Republic.
I understand, Master.
We must move quickly.
The Jedi are relentless.
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.
We will catch them off-balance.
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...
to save Padm.
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?
Their betrayal will be dealt with.
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...
go to the Mustafar system.
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...
and the other
separatist leaders.
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!
And...
we shall have... peace.
Sergeant, over here!
Hurry! All of them!
All Red units, let's move it!
Come on. Let's go!
Commander, contact your troops.
Tell them to move to the higher levels.
Very good, sir.
By the way,
I think you'll be needing this.
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.
Yes, sir.
Commander Cody...
the time has come.
Execute order 66.
Yes, my lord.
Blast him!
Come on!
Execute order 66.
It will be done, my lord.
It will be done, my lord.
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.
What are we going to do?
The chancellor's offce indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be all right.
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.
And so it is.
Get him!
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Tarfful.
Goodbye, Chewbacca.
Miss you I will.
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...
before they walk into
this catastrophe.
Did you fnd Kenobi?
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.
Start loading your men on the ships.
Move it.
Emergency code 913.
I have no contact
on any frequency.
Master Kenobi.
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.
We havejust rescued
Master Yoda.
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.
We're sending you our coordinates.
Hush! Not so loud.
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fne.
I came to see if
you and the baby are safe.
What's happening?
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.
I can't believe that.
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.
What are you gonna do?
I will not betray the Republic.
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...
and with the senate
and with you.
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.
Many Jedi have been killed.
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.
Anakin, I'm afraid.
Have faith, my love.
Everything will soon be set right.
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.
Things will be different.
I promise.
Please, wait for me.
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.
Take care, my little friend.
Oh, my lady,
is there anything I might do?
No, thank you, 3PO.
I feel so helpless.
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?
Heard from no one have we.
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.
That's why I went looking for Yoda.
Have we had any contact
from the temple?
Received a coded
retreat message we have.
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.
I agree.
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.
You have done well, Viceroy.
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...
he will take care of you.
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's offce, sir.
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...
at a special session of Congress.
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...
without keeping
the senate intact.
If a special session
of Congress there is...
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.
R2, stay with the ship.
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.
And the Jedi rebellion
has been foiled.
What's happened?
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.
Not even the younglings survived.
Killed not by clones this Padawan.
By a lightsabre he was.
Who?
Who could have done this?
The attempt on my life...
has left me scarred and deformed.
But I assure you.
My resolve has never been stronger!
Stop!
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...
the Republic will be reorganized...
into the frst Galactic Empire!
For a safe and secure society.
So this is how liberty dies.
With thunderous applause.
The war is over.
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
For the clones...
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.
Wait. Master.
There is something I must know.
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you fnd.
I must know the truth, Master.
It can't be.
It can't be.
You have done well,
my new apprentice.
Now, Lord Vader...
go and bring peace to the Empire.
I can't watch any more.
Destroy the Sith we must.
Send me to kill the emperor.
I will not kill Anakin.
To fght this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.
The boy you trained, gone he is.
Consumed by Darth Vader.
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.
I don't know where to look.
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and fnd him you will.
When was the last time
you saw him?
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?
Padm, I need your help.
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?
From himself.
Anakin has turned to the dark side.
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?
I have seen
a security hologram... of him...
killing younglings.
Not Anakin. He couldn't.
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.
I don't believe you.
I can't.
I must fnd him.
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?
He has become
a very great threat.
I can't.
Anakin is the father, isn't he?
I'm so sorry.
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.
The fghting's over.
And this is personal.
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.
Besides, 3PO will look after me.
Oh, dear.
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.
It is fnished then.
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.
All droid units
must shut down immediately.
Very good, my lord.
I saw your ship.
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
What things?
He said you've turned
to the dark side.
That you... killed younglings.
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.
He cares about us.
Us?
He knows.
He wants to help you.
Anakin, all I want is your love.
Love won't save you, Padm.
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?
You're a good person.
Don't do this.
I won't lose you
the way I lost my mother.
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.
Come away with me.
Help me raise our child.
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away any more.
I have brought peace
to the Republic.
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.
I can overthrow him.
And together,
you and I can rule the galaxy...
make things the way
we want them to be.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.
I don't know you any more.
You're breaking my heart.
You're going down a path
I can't follow.
Because of Obi-Wan?
Because of what you've done.
What you plan to do.
Stop. Stop now. Come back.
- I love you.
- Liar!
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.
Let her go, Anakin.
Let her go.
You turned her against me!
You have done that yourself.
You will not
take her from me!
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.
I do not fear
the dark side as you do.
I have brought peace...
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.
Your new empire?
Don't make me kill you.
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!
If you're not with me...
then you're my enemy.
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
I will do what I must.
You will try.
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?
Master Yoda.
You survived.
Surprised?
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.
Now you will experience...
the full power of the dark side.
I have waited a long time
for this moment...
my little green friend.
At last the Jedi are no more.
Not if anything
to say about it I have.
At an end your rule is.
And not short enough it was.
If so powerful you are...
why leave?
You will not stop me.
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.
There's no sign of his body, sir.
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate take-off.
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
Into exile I must go.
Failed I have.
I have failed you, Anakin.
I have failed you.
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.
Then you are lost!
This is the end for you, my master.
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.
You underestimate my power.
Don't try it.
You were the chosen one!
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!
I hate you!
You were my brother, Anakin.
I loved you.
Master Kenobi.
We have Miss Padm on board.
Yes. Please, please hurry.
We should leave this dreadful place.
Is Anakin all right?
Your Majesty, this way.
There he is.
He's still alive.
Get a medical capsule immediately.
Yes, sir. Right away.
Excuse me, Master Yoda.
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.
We'll take her to
the medical centre. Quickly.
Medically, she's completely healthy.
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.
She has lost the will to live.
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.
Babies?
She's carrying twins.
Luke.
Oh, Luke.
- It's a girl.
- Leia.
There's good in him.
I know.
I know there's... still-
Lord Vader.
Can you hear me?
Yes, Master.
Where is Padm?
Is she safe?
Is she all right?
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.
I? I couldn't have.
She was alive. I felt it!
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.
Split up they should be.
My wife and I will take the girl.
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.
She will be loved with us.
And what of the boy?
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.
I will take the child
and watch over him.
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.
Training?
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.
Your old master.
Qui-Gon?
How to commune with him
I will teach you.
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?
I'm placing these droids
in your care.
Treat them well.
Clean them up.
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.
What?

1
[Alarm]
Did you hear that?
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.
This is madness.
[Beep Whistle Blip]
[Whistle Beep Beep]
We're doomed.
[Beep Beep]
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.
[Clanking]
What's that?
[Beep Blip Beep]
R2-D2, where are you?
[Beep Blip Blip]
At last!
Where have you been?
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel,
smashed into who knows what!
Wait a minute. Where are you going?
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?
What have you done with those plans?
We intercepted no transmissions.
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans,
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!
There's one. Set for stun.
She'll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.
You'll be deactivated for sure.
[Beep Blip]
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease!
Now come out before somebody sees you.
[Whistle Blip Blip]
Secret mission? What plans?
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.
I'm going to regret this.
There goes another one.
Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.
It must have short-circuited.
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
[Whistle Beep Whistle]
Oh.
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.
The Imperial Senate
will not sit still for this.
When they hear
you've attacked a diplomatic-
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
Take her away!
Holding her is dangerous.
If word of this gets out,
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.
I've traced the rebel spies to her.
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
Leave that to me.
Send a distress signal,
and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed.
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship,
and no transmissions were made.
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting,
but no life-forms were aboard.
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.
Send a detachment down to retrieve them-
See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one to stop us this time.
Yes, sir.
How did we get into this mess?
I really don't know how.
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.
[Blip Whistle]
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.
What a desolate place this is!
[Bleep Blip]
Where do you think you're going?
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.
This way is much easier.
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?
[Beep Blip]
Don't get technical with me.
What mission? What are you talking about?
[Beep Beep]
I've just about had enough of you.
Go that way.
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.
And don't let me catch you following me
begging for help,
because you won't get it.
[Beep Whistle]
[Blip Bleep Blip]
No more adventures.
I'm not going that way.
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.
He tricked me into going this way,
but he'll do no better.
Wait! What's that?
A transport.
I'm saved!
Over here!
Hey!
Help! Please help!
[Whistle Whistle]
[Beep Blip Blip Beep]
[Speaking Alien Language]
[Beep Whistle Blip]
[Whistle Blip Blip]
R2?
[Blip Blip]
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
[Whistle Whistle]
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.
Look, sir, droids.
We stopped.
Wake up! Wake up!
[Beep Blip Beep Beep]
We're doomed.
[Speaking Alien Language]
Do you think they'll melt us down?
[Beep Blip]
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Will this never end?
[Speaking Alien Language]
All right, fine. Let's go.
Luke! Luke!
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.
Doesn't look like we have much of a choice,
but I'll remind him.
[Speaking Alien Language]
Yeah, we'll take that red one.
No, not that one.
[Speaking Alien Language]
I suppose you're
programmed for etiquette and protocol.
Protocol? Why, it's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs-
I have no need for a protocol droid.
Of course you haven't, sir.
Not in an environment such as this.
That is why I have been programmed-
What I really need is a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.
Vaporators? Sir, my firstjob
was programming binary load lifters,
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.
Can you speak Bocce?
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me-
Yeah, all right.
Shut up. I'll take this one.
Luke!
Take these two over to the garage, will you?
I want them cleaned up before dinner.
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.
Now come on. Get to it.
All right. Come on.
[Whining]
And the red one. Come on.
[Beep Beep]
Well, come on, red. Let's go.
[Beep Whistle]
Uncle Owen!
Yeah?
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
[Bleep Bleep Bleep]
Excuse me, sir,
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.
Uncle Owen, what about that one?
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.
Take this away.
You'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.
[Beep Blip]
O.K. Let's go.
Now, don't you forget this.
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.
[Whistle]
Thank the maker!
This oil bath is going to feel so good.
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination,
I can barely move.
Itjust isn't fair.
Oh, Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.
Is there anything I might do to help?
No. Not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.
I don't think so, sir.
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things,
not on this planet, anyway.
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
Well, if there's
a bright center to the universe,
you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
You can call me Luke.
I see, Sir Luke.
Ha ha.
Just Luke.
Oh... And I am C-3 PO, human-cyborg relations.
This is my counterpart... R2-D2.
Hello.
[Beep Beep Blip]
You got a lot of carbon scoring.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
With all we've been through,
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are,
what with the rebellion and all.
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!
That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.
Have you been in many battles?
Several, I think.
Actually, there's not much to tell.
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.
Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.
Well, my little friend,
you got something jammed in here real good.
Were you on a Starcruiser or-
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
What's this?
"What is what"? He asked you a question.
What is that?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
[Beep Blip Blip]
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.
Old data. Pay it no mind.
Who is she? She's beautiful.
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.
A person of some importance, I believe.
Our captain was attached-
Is there any more to this recording?
[Whistle Blip Beep]
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.
[Beep Blip Beep]
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi,
a resident of these parts,
and it's a private message for him.
Quite frankly, sir,
I don't know what he's talking about.
Our last master was Captain Antilles.
But with all we've been through,
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
I beg your pardon, sir,
but do you know what he's talking about?
I don't know any Obi-Wan,
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
He's kind of a strange old hermit.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.
[Beep! Beep!]
He says the restraining bolt
has short-circuited his recording system.
He suggests that if you remove the bolt,
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.
Oh, yeah. Well...
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.
O. K...
There you go.
Wait a minute. Where'd she go?
Bring her back. Play back the entire message.
"What message"?
The one you've just been playing!
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.
Luke! Luke!
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
I'm sorry, sir,
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.
[Beep Blip]
Just you reconsider playing
that message for him.
[Beep Beep]
No, I don't think he likes you at all.
No, I don't like you, either.
[Beep Beep]
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought
might have been stolen.
What makes you think that?
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?
Mm-mm.
I wonder if he's related to Ben.
That wizard's just a crazy old man.
Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit
to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?
He won't.
I don't think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time
as your father.
He knew my father?
I told you to forget it.
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.
In the morning, I want them up there on the
south ridge working on those condensers.
Yes, sir.
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement
about me staying on another season?
And if these new droids do work out,
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.
You mean the next semester before the harvest?
Sure. There's more than enough droids.
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It's only one season more.
This year we'll make enough on the harvest
that I'll be able to hire more hands
and then you can
go to the academy next year.
You must understand I need you here, Luke.
But it's a whole 'nother year!
Look, it's only one more season.
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.
Where are you going?
Looks like I'm going nowhere.
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.
It means so much to him.
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Ooh!
What are you doing hiding back there?
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
Kept babbling on about his mission.
Oh, no.
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.
Even I can't understand their logic at times.
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.
Blast it!
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait until morning.
Uncle Owen:
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.
All right! I'll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.
Oh, he excels at that, sir.
Come on.
Luke?
Luke!
Have you seen Luke this morning?
He said he had some things to do
before he started today,
so he left early.
Did he take
those two new droids with him?
I think so.
Well, he better have those units in the south range
repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay.
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!
[Speaking Alien Language]
Hey, whoa! Where do you think you're going?
[Beep Beep Beep]
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
[Beep]
And don't talk to me of your mission, either.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here!
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.
[Whistle Whistle]
What's wrong with him now?
There are several creatures approaching
from the southeast.
Sandpeople, or worse.
Come on. Let's go have a look.
Come on!
Well, there are two banthas down there,
but I don't see any... Wait a second.
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.
[Beep Whistle]
[Beep Beep]
[Howl]
Hello, there.
[Beep Blip]
Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid.
[Beep Blip Blip]
Oh, don't worry. He'll be all right.
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
Ben?
Ben Kenobi?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be traveled lightly.
[Beep Beep]
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?
This little droid.
[Blip Blip]
I think he's searching for his former master,
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.
Now, that's a name I've not
heard in a long time.
A long time.
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.
Oh, he's not dead.
Not yet.
You know him?
Well, of course I know him. He's me.
[Beep Beep]
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan
since, oh, before you were born.
Well, then the droid does belong to you.
I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
Very interesting.
[Growling]
I think we better get indoors.
The Sandpeople are easily startled,
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.
[Beep]
3 PO.
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.
Can you stand?
We've got to get out of here
before the Sandpeople return.
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.
There's no sense
in you risking yourself on my account.
I'm done for.
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?
Quickly. They're on the move.
No, my father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.
You fought in the Clone Wars?
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy
and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me,
I have something here for you.
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough,
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some
damn-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.
Sure. Go ahead.
What is it?
It's your father's lightsaber.
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy
or random as a blaster.
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights were the guardians
of peace and justice in the old Republic,
before the dark times,
before the Empire.
How did my father die?
A young Jedi named Darth Vader,
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil,
helped the Empire
hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
He betrayed and murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
It's an energy field created
by all living things.
It surrounds us, penetrates us,
it binds the galaxy together.
[Beep Blip Blip Beep]
Now let's see if we can't
figure out what you are, my little friend,
and where you come from.
I saw part of a message he was...
I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present my
father's request to you in person.
But my ship has fallen under attack,
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
My father will know how to retrieve it.
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've got to get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help.
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.
It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it,
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.
It's all such a long way from here.
That's your uncle talking.
My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
You can get a transport
there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
You must do what you feel is right, of course.
Until this battle station
is fully operational,
we are vulnerable.
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you realize.
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander,
not to this battle station.
The rebellion will continue to gain support
in the Imperial Senate-
The Imperial Senate will no longer be
of any concern to us.
I have just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.
That's impossible.
How will the emperor
maintain control without the bureaucracy?
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.
Fear will keep the local systems in line-
fear of this battle station.
And what of the rebellion?
If the rebels have obtained
a complete technical readout of this station,
it is possible, however unlikely,
that they might
find a weakness and exploit it.
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station would be a useless gesture,
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.
I suggest we use it.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror
you've constructed.
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
Don't try to frighten us
with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion
hasn't helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortre-
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Enough of this. Vader, release him.
As you wish.
This bickering is pointless.
Lord Vader will provide us
with the location of the rebel fortress
by the time this station is operational.
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
bantha tracks.
It's just, I've never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.
They didn't,
but we are meant to think they did.
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.
And these blast points,
too accurate... for Sandpeople.
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughterJawas?
If they traced the robots here,
they may have learned who they sold them to,
and that would lead them back... home!
Wait, Luke!
It's too dangerous!
Uncle Owen!
Aunt Beru!
Uncle Owen!
And now, Your Highness,
we will discuss the location
of your hidden rebel base.
There's nothing you could have done, Luke,
had you been there.
You'd have been killed, too,
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.
Mos Eisley spaceport.
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.
We must be cautious.
[Chattering]
[Braying]
How long have you had these droids?
Three or four seasons.
They're up for sale if you want them.
Let me see your identification.
You don't need to see his identification.
We don't need to see his identification.
These aren't the droids you're looking for.
These aren't the droids we're looking for.
He can go about his business.
You can go about your business.
Move along.
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!
Go on, go on.
I can't understand how we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.
Do you really think we're gonna find
a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here,
only watch your step.
This place can be a little rough.
I'm ready for anything.
Come along, R2.
[Alien Lounge Music Plays]
[Laughter]
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.
What?
Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.
Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.
I heartily agree with you, sir.
Uh...
I'll have one of those.
[Speaking Alien Language]
He doesn't like you.
I'm sorry.
I don't like you, either.
You just watch yourself.
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
I'll be careful.
You'll be dead!
This little one's not worth the effort.
Come, let me get you something.
Aah!
I'm all right.
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.
I don't like the look of this.
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for
passage to the Alderaan system.
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.
I've outrun imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
She's fast enough for you, old man.
What's the cargo?
Only passengers... myself, the boy,
two droids,
and no questions asked.
What is it, some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
And it's gonna cost you something extra.
10,000, all in advance.
10,000?
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!
But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.
We don't have to sit here and listen-
We can pay you 2,000 now
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.
Seventeen, huh?
O.K. You guys got yourselves a ship.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.
Ninety-four.
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.
All right. We'll check it out.
17,000!
Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.
You'll have to sell your speeder.
That's O.K. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.
[Speaking Huttese]
Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
[Speaking Huttese]
It's too late. You should have paid him
when you had the chance.
Jabba's put a price on your head so large...
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.
I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba-
Jabba's through with you.
He has no time for smugglers...
who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.
Over my dead body.
That's the idea.
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.
I'll bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.
It'll be some time before we can extract
any information from her.
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.
What do you mean?
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.
Set your course for Alderaan.
With pleasure.
Lock the door, R2.
Check this side of the street.
The door's locked. Move on to the next.
I would much rather have gone
with Master Luke than stay here with you.
I don't know what
all this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.
[Beep Beep]
You watch your language.
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.
Look at this.
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.
It'll be enough.
[Speaking Huttese]
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!
Right here, Jabba.
I've been waitin' for you.
[Speaking Huttese]
Have you now.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
[Speaking Huttese]
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
Why haven't you paid me...
and why did you fry poor Greedo?
Look, Jabba, next time you want to talk to me,
come see me yourself.
Don't send one of these twerps.
Han, I can't make exceptions.
What if everyone who smuggled for me...
dropped their cargo at the first sign...
of an imperial starship?
It's not good business.
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
You think I had a choice?
But I got a nice, easy charter.
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.
Han, my boy, you're the best.
So, for an extra 20-
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.
Okay, 15%.
But if you fail me again...
I'll put a price on your head so big...
you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
Jabba... you're a wonderful human being.
Come on!
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.
[Speaking Alien Language]
What a piece of junk!
She'll make.5 past light speed.
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board,
we'll get outta here.
Hello, sir.
Which way?
[Speaking Alien Language]
All right, men, load your weapons.
Stop that ship! Blast them!
Chewie, get us out of here!
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.
[Grrr]
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.
Try and hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields while I make
the calculations for the jump to light speed.
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!
Watch your mouth, kid,
or you're gonna find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.
Here's where the fun begins.
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?
What's that flashing?
We're losing a deflector shield.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
We've entered the Alderaan system.
Governor Tarkin.
I should have expected to find you
holding Vader's leash.
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.
Charming to the last.
You don't know how hard I found it
signing the order to terminate your life.
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.
Princess Leia, before your execution...
I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony
that will make this battle station operational.
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin,
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.
In a way, you have determined the choice
of the planet that will be destroyed first.
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base,
I have chosen to test this station's destructive power
on your home planet ofAlderaan.
No! Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
You would prefer another target?
A military target?
Then name the system.
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.
Where is the rebel base?
Dantooine.
They're on Dantooine.
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.
What?
You're far too trusting.
Dantooine is too remote to make
an effective demonstration, but don't worry.
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.
No!
Commence primary ignition.
Are you all right? What's wrong?
I felt a great
disturbance in the Force,
as if millions of voices suddenly cried out
in terror and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened.
You'd better get on with your exercises.
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.
I told you I'd outrun them.
Don't everybody thank me at once.
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.
Now be careful, R2.
Argh!
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms
out of their sockets when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.
Grrr...
I see your point, sir.
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.
Argh!
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.
You mean it controls your actions?
Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
[Han Solo Laughs]
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff,
but I've never seen anything to make me believe
there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
This time, let go your conscious self...
and act on instinct.
With the blast shield down, I can't even see.
How am I supposed to fight?
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.
Stretch out with your feelings.
You see? You can do it.
Han: I call it luck.
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.
Look, good against remotes is one thing.
Good against the living, that's something else.
[Beeping]
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.
Yes?
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
They found the remains of a rebel base,
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.
They are now conducting an extensive search
of the surrounding systems.
She lied. She lied to us!
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.
Terminate her immediately.
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.
What the
Arrghh arrgh!
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.
Some kind of asteroid collision.
It's not on any of the charts.
What's going on?
Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.
What do you mean? Where is it?
That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.
What? How?
Destroyed by the Empire.
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than-
[Beep]
There's another ship coming in.
Maybe they know what happened.
It's an imperial fighter.
It followed us!
No. It's a short-range fighter.
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.
It would be as well to let it go.
It's too far out of range.
Not for long.
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep
into space on its own.
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.
Well, he ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.
I think I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.
That's no moon.
It's a space station.
It's too big to be a space station.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Turn the ship around.
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse!
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!
Why are we still moving
towards it?!
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!
There's got to be something you can do!
There's nothing I can do about it, kid.
I'm at full power. I'm gonna have to shut down.
They're not gonna get me without a fight.
You can't win,
but there are alternatives to fighting.
Clear Bay 327.
We are opening the magnetic field.
To your stations!
Come with me.
Close all outboard shields.
Yes?
[Beep]
We've captured a freighter
entering the remains of the Alderaan system.
Its markings match those ofa ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
They must be trying to
return the stolen plans to the princess.
She may yet be of some use to us.
Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9. Release charge.
316, report to control.
There's no one on board, sir.
According to the log,
the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.
It must be a decoy, sir.
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.
Did you find any droids?
No, sir. If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.
Yes, sir.
I sense something,
a presence I've not felt since-
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
I want every part of this ship checked.
There's no one here.
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
I use them for smuggling.
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.
Leave that to me.
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?
Argh!
The ship's all yours.
If the scanners pick up anything,
report it immediately.
All right, let's go.
[Thud]
Han: Hey, down there!
Could you give us a hand with this?
[Zap Zap]
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
TK-421, do you copy?
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.
Grrr!
Between his howling and
your blasting everything in sight,
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.
Bring them on! I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.
We've found the computer outlet, sir.
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.
[Beep Blip]
[Blip Bleep Whistle]
He says he's found the main controls
to the power beam that's holding the ship here.
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.
Whatever you say.
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.
I want to go with you.
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.
They must be delivered safely,
or other star systems
will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
Your destiny lies
along a different path from mine.
The Force will be with you always.
Argh argh argh!
You said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Ben is a great man.
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
I didn't hear you give any ideas.
Well, anything's better than just
hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
Who do you think...
[Beep Beep]
What is it?
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
He says "I've found her"
and keeps repeating "She's here."
Well, who... who has he found?
Princess Leia.
The princess? She's here?!
Princess?
Where? Where is she?
Princess? What's going on?
[Beep Blip]
[Bleep Blip Beep]
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
[Beep Beep Blip]
I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
Oh, no!
We've got to do something!
What are you talking about?
The droids belong to her.
She's the one in the message.
We got to help her.
Now look, don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right here.
But he didn't know she was here.
Just find a way back into that
detention block.
I'm not going anywhere.
They're going to execute her.
Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn't
want to just wait here to be captured.
Now all you want to do is stay?
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.
But they're gonna kill her!
Better her than me.
She's rich.
Argh!
Rich?
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...
What?
Well, more well than you can imagine.
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.
You'll get it.
I better.
You will.
All right, kid. You better
be right about this.
All right.
What's your plan?
Um...
3 PO, hand me those binders there, will you?
O.K.
Now... I'm gonna put these on you.
Grrr!
O.K. Han, you... you put those on.
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking,
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?
Lock the door.
And hope they don't have blasters.
That isn't very reassuring.
[Beep Whistle]
Grrr!
517 to scanner control.
316, report to control.
53 to upper bay door.
Luke: I can't see a thing in this helmet.
Han: This is not gonna work.
Luke: Why didn't you say so before?
I did say so before.
Where are you taking this... thing?
Luke: Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.
I wasn't notified.
I'll have to clear it.
Argh!
Han: Look out! He's loose!
Luke: He'll tear us all apart!
I'll get him!
Look out!
Arrgh!
[Beep Beep Beep]
Han: We gotta find out
which cell this princess of yours is in.
Here it is2187. You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.
[Beep Beep Beep]
Uh... Uh, everything's under control.
Situation normal.
What happened?
Had a slight weapons malfunction,
but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.
We're fineWe're all fine here now. Thank you.
How are you?
We're sending a squad up.
Uh, negative, negative!
We have aa reactor leak here, uh, now.
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.
Who is this?
What's your operating number?
Uh...
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke! We're gonna have company!
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?
Huh?
Oh, the uniform.
I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.
You're who?
I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?
Come on!
He is here.
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
What makes you think so?
A tremor in the Force.
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.
Surely he must be dead by now.
Don't underestimate the Force.
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.
[Beep]
You, my friend,
are all that's left of their religion.
Yes.
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.
Argh!
Get behind me! Get behind me!
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.
Can't get out that way.
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.
C-3PO, C-3PO!
Yes, sir?
Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?
We've been cut off!
What was that? I didn't copy.
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.
The main entrance seems to be
the only way in or out.
All other information on your level is restricted.
Stormtrooper: Open up in there!
Open up in there!
Oh, no!
There isn't any other way out!
Argh!
I can't hold them off forever!
Now what?!
This is some rescue! You came in here,
and you didn't have a plan for getting out?
He's the brains, sweetheart!
Well, I didn't-
What the hell are you doing?
Somebody has to save our skins.
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.
Get in there!
Arrgh!
Get in there, you big furry oaf!
I don't care what you smell.
Get in there, and don't worry about it.
Wonderful girl!
Either I'm going to kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.
Get in there!
Aah!
Ah!
Argh!
The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
What an incredible smell you've discovered!
Let's get out of here.
Get away from there.
No, wait!
Will you forget it?! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!
Absolutely, Your Worship.
Look, I had everything
under control till you led us down here!
Ya know, it's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us!
It could be worse.
Woorr!
It's worse.
There's something alive in here.
That's your imagination.
Something just moved past my leg.
Look! Did you see that?
What?
Grrr!
Woorr!
Kid!
Luke!
Leia: Aah!
Woorr!
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!
Blast it! My gun's jammed.
Where?
Anywhere!
Luke, Luke!
[Clanking]
Help him!
What happened?
I don't know.
Itjust let go of me and disappeared.
I got a bad feeling about this.
Grrr!
[Clanking]
The walls are moving!
Don't just stand there!
Try and brace it with something.
Grrr!
Help me!
Wait a minute!
3PO!
Come in, 3PO!
3PO!
Where could he be?
Take over. See to him.
Look, there.
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.
If you hurry, you might catch them.
Follow me.
You stand guard.
Come on.
[Whistle Blip Beep]
Oh!
All this excitement has overrun the circuits
in my counterpart here.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
All right.
3PO!
Come in, 3PO!
3PO!
Get on top!
I can't.
Where could he be?! 3PO!
3 PO, will you come in!
They aren't here.
Something must have happened to them.
See if they've been captured.
Hurry.
[Whistle Blip Beep]
One thing's for sure,
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.
Get on top of it.
I'm trying.
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?
[Whistle Blip Beep]
"Use the comlink"?
Oh, my. I forgot. I turned it off.
Are you there, sir?
3PO!
We've had some problems.
Will you shut up and listen to me?!
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level, will ya?!
Do you copy!?
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!
[Bleep Bleep Whistle]
[Beep Blip Blip]
What?
Ha ha!
[Screaming]
Listen to them. They're dying, R2!
Curse my metal body!
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master.
We're all right! You did great!
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number... Where are we?
3263827!
If we can just avoid any more female advice,
we ought to be able to get outta here.
Well, let's get moving.
Grrr!
Where are you going?
Aw...
No, wait! They'll hear!
Come here, you big coward.
Chewie, come here.
Listen...
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,
but from now on, you do as I tell you, O. K?
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.
I take orders from just one personme.
It's a wonder you're still alive.
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?
No reward is worth this.
Give me regular reports, please.
Right.
Do you know what's going on?
Maybe it's another drill.
You seen that new VT-16?
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.
They say it's... it's quite a thing to see-
What was that?
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.
There she is.
C-3PO? Do you copy?
Yes, sir.
Are you safe?
For the moment.
We're in the main hangar across from the ship.
We're right above you. Stand by.
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.
Nice! Come on.
It's them!
Blast them!
Get back to the ship!
Where are you going? Come back!
He certainly has courage.
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.
Aah!
Whoop!
I think we took a wrong turn.
There's no lock.
That oughta hold them for a while.
Quick! We've got to get across.
Find the controls that extend the bridge.
I think I just blasted it.
They're coming through!
Here, hold this.
Here they come.
For luck.
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
Where could they be?
[Whistle Blip Beep]
Close the blast doors!
Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.
The circle is now complete.
When I left you, I was but the learner.
Now / am the master.
Only a master of evil, Darth.
Your powers are weak, old man.
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down,
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.
You should not have come back.
Didn't we just leave this party?
What kept you?
We, uh, ran into some old friends.
The ship all right?
It seems O.K., if we can get to it.
I just hope the old man
got the tractor beam out of commission.
Look!
Come on, R2, we're going.
[Beep Beep]
Now's our chance! Go!
Ben?
No!
Come on!
Luke, it's too late!
Blast the door, kid!
Obi-Wan... Run, Luke, run!
I hope that old man got that tractor beam
out of commission, or this is gonna be
a real short trip. O.K. Hit it!
Aargh!
We're coming up on their sentry ships.
Hold them off.
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.
I can't believe he's gone.
There wasn't anything you could have done.
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.
You in, kid? O.K., stay sharp.
Here they come.
They're coming in too fast!
We've lost the lateral controls!
Don't worry. She'll hold together.
Hear me, baby? Hold together.
Ha ha!
Got him! I got him!
Great, kid! Don't get cocky.
There's still two more of them out there!
That's it! We did it!
We did it!
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!
[Whistle Bleep Blip]
Are they away?
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
This had better work.
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.
That doesn't sound too hard.
They let us go.
It's the only explanation
for the ease of our escape.
Easy? You call that easy?
They're tracking us.
Not this ship, sister.
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.
What's so important?
What's he carrying?
The technical readouts
of that battle station.
I only hope that when the data's analyzed,
a weakness can be found.
It's not over yet.
It is for me, sister.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.
You needn't worry about your reward.
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.
Your friend is quite a mercenary.
I wonder if he really cares about anything...
or anybody.
I care.
So...
what do you think of her, Han?
I'm trying not to, kid.
Good.
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
I don't know. What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me-
No!
You're safe.
When we heard about Alderaan,
we feared the worst.
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.
It's our only hope.
[Beep]
Yes.
We're approaching the planet Yavin.
The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
We are preparing to orbit the planet.
The battle station is heavily shielded
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.
Its defenses are designed
around a direct large-scale assault.
A small, one-man fighter
should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
Pilot: Pardon me for asking, sir,
but what good are snub fighters
going to be against that?
The Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter to be any threat,
or they'd have a tighter defense.
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia
has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
The approach will not be easy.
You're required to maneuver straight down this trench
and skim the surface to this point.
The target area is only 2 meters wide.
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.
A precise hit will start a chain reaction
which should destroy the station.
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
That's impossible, even for a computer.
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.
They're not much bigger than 2 meters.
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi...
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.
All flight crews, man your stations.
So... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?
That's right. Yeah.
I got some old debts
I got to pay off with this stuff.
And even if I didn't,
you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do ya?
Why don't you come with us?
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.
It's more like... suicide.
All right.
Take care of yourself, Han.
I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
Hey, Luke.
May the Force be with you.
Argh!
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.
All pilots to your stations.
What's wrong?
Oh, it's Han.
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.
I only wish Ben were here.
Open main launch tubes.
Main launch tubes opening, sir.
Hey, Luke!
Biggs!
I don't believe it. How are you?
Great.
Hey, coming up?
I'll be right up there with you,
and have I got stories to tell you.
Are you sure you can handle this ship?
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.
You'll do all right.
Thank you, sir. I'll try.
I gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your stories
when we get back, all right?
All right.
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.
Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up.
You want a new one?
Not on your life. That little droid and I
have been through a lot together.
You O.K., R2?
[Blip Beep]
Good.
Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.
Hang on tight, R2. You've got to come back.
[Beep Blip Beep]
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?
[Beep Beep Beep]
Obi-Wan:
Luke, the Force will be with you.
Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.
All wings report in.
Red 10 standing by.
Red Seven standing by.
Red Three standing by.
Red Six standing by.
Red Nine standing by.
Red Two standing by.
Red 11 standing by.
Red Five standing by.
[Beep Beep]
Lock S-foils in attack position.
We're passing through
the magnetic field.
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.
Look at the size of that thing!
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.
This is it, boys.
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
I copy, Gold Leader.
We're starting for the target shaft now.
We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis
and try and draw their fire.
Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
I see it. Stay low.
This is Red Five. I'm going in.
Luke, pull up!
Are you all right?
I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader,
but they're so small,
they're evading our turbolasers.
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming
from the right side of that deflection tower.
I'm on it.
I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
I'm right with you, Red Three.
I've got a problem here.
Eject.
I can hold it.
Pull up!
No, I'm allAah!
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.
Obi-Wan:
Luke, trust your feelings.
Squad leaders, we've picked up
a new group of signals.
Enemy fighters coming your way.
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.
Pick up your visual scanning.
Here they come.
Watch it. You've got one on your tail.
I'm hit!
You've picked one up! Watch it!
I can't see it!
He's on me tight. I can't shake him!
I'll be right there.
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.
Fall in! Fall in!
Watch your back, Luke.
Watch your back.
Fighters above you, coming in.
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.
Hang on back there.
Red Six, can you see Red Five?
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?
I can't shake him!
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?
Thanks, Wedge.
Good shooting, Wedge.
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.
I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.
Stay in attack formation.
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.
Switch all power to front deflector screen.
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?
Say about 20 guns
some on the surface, some on the towers.
Death Star will be in range in five minutes.
Switch to targeting computer.
Computer locked. Getting a signal.
The guns! They've stopped!
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.
They're coming in! Three marks at 210.
I'll take them myself. Cover me.
Yes, sir.
It's no good. I can't maneuver.
Stay on target.
We're too close.
Stay on target.
Loosen up!
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.
I copy, Gold Leader.
They came from behind.
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.
Should I have your ship standing by?
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances.
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.
Red boys, this is Red Leader.
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.
This is Red Two flying toward you.
Red Three standing by.
Red Leader, this is Base One.
Keep half your group
out of range for the next run.
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.
Hold up here and wait for my signal
to start your run.
This is it!
We should be able to see it by now.
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them from where you are?
No sign of any Wait. Coming in.35.
I see them.
I'm in range.
Target's coming up.
Just hold them off for a few seconds.
Close up formation.
Almost there.
You'd better let her loose.
They're right behind me.
Almost there.
I can't hold them.
Aah!
It's away!
It's a hit!
Negative, negative. It didn't go in.
Itjust impacted on the surface.
Red Leader, we're right above you.
Turn to.05. We'll cover for you.
Stay there. I just lost my starboard engine.
Get set up for your attack run.
Aah!
Rebel base, one minute and closing.
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
We're going in full throttle.
That ought to keep those fighters off our back.
Right with you, boss.
Luke, at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?
It'll be just like Beggars Canyon back home.
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.
Are you sure the computer can hit it?
Watch yourself. Increase speed, full throttle.
What about that tower?
You worry about those fighters!
I'll worry about the tower!
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again.
See if you can't lock it down.
[Beep Blip Beep]
Fighters coming in.3.
I'm hit! I can't stay with you!
Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.
Sorry.
Let him go. Stay on the leader.
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in
much faster this time. We can't hold them.
R2, try and increase the power.
[Beep Beep Beep]
Hurry up, Luke!
Quick! Quick!
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.
I'm on the leader.
Hang on, R2.
Obi-Wan:
Use the Force, Luke.
Let go, Luke.
The Force is strong with this one.
Luke, trust me.
His computer's off.
Luke, you switched off
your targeting computer!
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm all right.
[Beep Blip Beep]
[Eeeeee]
I've lost R2!
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
Rebel base in range.
You may fire when ready.
Commence primary ignition.
I have you now.
What?
Yahoo!
Look out!
You're all clear, kid!
Now let's blow this thing and go home!
Stand by.
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!
Obi-Wan:
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.
[Cheering]
Luke!
Hey! Hey!
I knew you'd come back. I just knew it.
Well, I wasn't going to let you
get all the credit and take all the reward.
Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
Oh, no!
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?
We'll get to work on him right away.
You must repair him.
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help,
I'll gladly donate them.
He'll be all right.
Argh!
[Whistle]
[Beep Beep]
Argh!

Echo Three to Echo Seven.
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?
Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed.
I'm going back.
Right. I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.
Steady.
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?
Chewie. Chewie?
All right.
Don't lose your temper.
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.
Solo.
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.
Thank you, General.
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.
That's right.
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.
Han.
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Han, we need you.
- We need?
- Yes.
- What about you need?
- I need?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.
No. That's not it.
Come on.
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.
Am I?
Then why are you following me?
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.
You could use a good kiss!
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.
It's supposed to be freezing.
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.
Oh, switch off!
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?
Deck Officer.
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might I--
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?
- Why not?
- Impossible man.
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.
-We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
-The temperature's dropping too rapidly.
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.
Then I'll see you in hell.
You must come along now, R2.
There's really
nothing more we can do.
And my joints are freezing up.
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no--
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals ...
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.
The shield doors must be closed.
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes ...
from time to time.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.
Luke.
Luke.
Ben?
You will go to
the Dagobah system.
Dagobah system?
There you will
learn from Yoda ...
the Jedi master
who instructed me.
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.
- Not much time.
- Ben.
Hang on, kid.
Dagobah system. Dagobah.
This may smell bad, kid ...
Yoda.
but it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.
Ben. Dagobah.
I thought they smelled bad ...
on the outside.
Echo Base, I've got something.
Not much,
but it could be a life form.
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.
This is Rogue Two.
Captain Solo, do you copy?
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.
Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.
Well, Your Worship ...
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.
I had nothing to do with it.
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave ...
until we've activated the energy field.
That's a good story.
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.
Laugh it up, fuzzball ...
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.
She expressed
her true feelings for me.
My --
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted ...
scruffy-looking nerf herder!
Who's scruffy-lookin'?
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.
Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.
Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.
Take it easy.
Excuse us, please.
Princess, we have a visitor.
We picked up something
outside Zone 1 2 moving east.
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.
There's something
very weak coming through.
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.
Send Rogues 1 0 and 1 1
to Station 38.
- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?
Droid of some kind.
I didn't hit it that hard.
- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.
It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.
We'd better start the evacuation.
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment ...
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead --
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.
That's it.
The rebels are there.
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.
- It could be smugglers --
- That is the system.
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.
Set your course
for the Hoth system.
General Veers,
prepare your men.
Admiral.
Groups Seven and 1 0
will stay behind to fly the speeders.
As soon as each transport is loaded ...
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.
Right, sir.
All right. That's it.
Try it.
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-4 7 s.
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
Okay, okay.
Hi, kid.
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.
Wait a second.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Be careful.
You too.
General, there's
a fleet of Star Destroyers ...
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.
Prepare for ground assault.
-What is it, General?
-The fleet has moved out of light speed.
ComScan has detected
an energy field ...
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.
He felt surprise was wiser.
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.
Yes, my lord.
Lord Vader.
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to --
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.
- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field ...
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.
Thank you, Lord Vader.
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.
Only two fighter escorts per ship.
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time ...
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?
The ion cannon will fire
several shots ...
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.
When you've gotten past
the energy shield ...
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.
Understood?
Good luck.
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.
Their primary target will be
the power generators.
Prepare to open shield.
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.
Good. Our first catch of the day.
Stand by, ion control.
Fire.
The first transport is away.
The first transport is away.
Feeling all right, sir?
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.
I know what you mean.
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.
Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.
All right, boys,
keep tight now.
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.
Steady, Dak.
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.
I'm coming in.
Hobbie, you still with me?
That armour's too strong for blasters.
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.
Stand by, Dak.
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.
Dak?
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.
Rogue Three.
Copy, Rogue Leader.
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.
I'll cover for you.
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.
Coming around, Rogue Leader.
Steady, Rogue Two.
Activate harpoon.
Good shot,Janson.
One more pass.
Cable out.
Let her go!
Detach cable.
Cable detached.
Come on!
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.
We have no choice.
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?
And do take good care of yourself.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
All troops will debark
for ground assault.
Prepare to target
the main generator.
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.
Set for position three.
Steady.
Stay tight and low.
This is it!
Hobbie!
I've been hit!
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.
Send all troops in Sector 1 2 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.
Imperial troops
have entered the base.
Imperial troops have entered --
Come on. That's it.
Give the evacuation code signal.
And get to your transports.
Wait for me.
Begin retreat!
Fall back!
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.
Target. Maximum firepower.
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.
I'll get her out on the Falcon.
Come on.
Where are you going?
Come back!
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!
- How typical.
- Come on.
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.
Wait! Wait!
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.
Sir, might I suggest that you --
It can wait.
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.
Come on! Come on!
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
See?
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.
Punch it!
R2.
Get her ready for take-off.
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.
Yes, R2.
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?
Stardestroyers,
two of'em coming right at us.
- Sir, might I suggest --
- Shut him up or shut him down!
Check the deflector shield.
Great. Well, we can still
outmanoeuvre them.
Take evasive action!
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!
They're getting closer.
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.
Watch what?
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so ...
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.
Horizontal boosters!
Alluvial dampers.
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.
Chewie!
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.
Han, get up here.
Come on, Chewie!
Asteroids.
- Chewie, set 271 .
- What are you doing?
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?
You don't have to do this
to impress me.
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field ...
- is approximately 3,720-to-1 .
- Never tell me the odds.
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.
I take it back.
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.
- Closer?
- Closer?
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.
There. That looks pretty good.
What looks pretty good?
Yeah. That'll do nicely.
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?
I hope you know
what you're doing.
Yeah. Me too.
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.
Massive life form readings though.
There's something alive down there.
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.
I know! I know!
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.
R2?
Where are you?
R2!
You be more careful.
R2, that way.
R2!
Oh, no.
Are you all right?
Come on.
You were lucky
to get out of there.
Anything broken?
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea ...
I'm beginning to agree with ya.
R2, what are we doing here?
It's like ...
something out of a dream or --
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy.
Yes, Admiral?
Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord ...
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk --
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?
No. I need you
to talk to the Falcon ...
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.
Not entirely stable?
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.
Let go.
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.
Sorry, sweetheart.
I haven't got time
for anything else.
Ready for some power?
Okay.
Let's see now.
Put that in there.
There you go.
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda ...
if he even exists.
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.
This place gives me the creeps.
Still ...
there's something familiar
about this place.
I don't know.
- I feel like --
- Feel like what?
Like we're being watched.
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.
I am wondering,
why are you here?
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?
Found someone you have,
I would say.
Right.
Help you I can. Yes.
I don't think so.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Great warrior.
Wars not make one great.
Put that down.
Hey! That's my dinner.
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.
Aw, cannot get your ship out.
Get out of there.
Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.
You're making a mess.
Hey, give me that.
Mine, or I will help you not.
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.
R2, let him have it.
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.
Jedi master. Yoda.
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?
Take you to him I will.
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.
Come.
Good food. Come.
Come, come.
R2 ...
stay and watch after the camp.
Where is R2 when I need him?
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate ...
but it has the most peculiar dialect.
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.
Here. And, Chewie ...
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.
Would you please
stop calling me that?
Sure, Leia.
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.
You could be a little nicer though.
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.
Occasionally, maybe ...
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.
Scoundrel?
I like the sound of that.
- Stop that.
- Stop what?
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.
I'm not trembling.
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.
I happen to like nice men.
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.
Sir, sir!
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.
That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.
Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed.
No, Captain, they're alive.
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field ...
so that we can send
a clear transmission.
Yes, my lord.
What is thy bidding, my master?
There is a great disturbance
in the Force.
I have felt it.
We have a new enemy --
the young rebel who destroyed
the Death Star.
I have no doubt this boy ...
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.
How is that possible?
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.
You will know it to be true.
He could destroy us.
He's just a boy.
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
The Force is strong with him.
The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi.
If he could be turned ...
he would become a powerful ally.
Yes.
He would be a great asset.
Can it be done?
He will join us or die, master.
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.
Eat. Eat.
Hot.
Good food. Good.
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?
Not far. Yoda not far.
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.
Root leaf. I cook.
Why wish you become Jedi?
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!
I cannot teach him.
The boy has no patience.
He will learn patience.
Much anger in him ...
like his father.
Was I any different
when you taught me?
No.
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.
I am ready.
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm --
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment ...
the most serious mind.
This one a long time have I watched.
All his life
has he looked away ...
to the future,
to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was ...
what he was doing.
Adventure.
Excitement.
A Jedi craves not these things.
You are reckless.
So was I, if you remember.
He is too old.
Yes, too old to begin the training.
But I've learned so much.
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.
I'm not afraid.
You will be.
You will be.
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion --
- I'm not interested in your opinion.
There's something out there.
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.
There it is. Listen!
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.
Then I'm going with you.
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.
Oh, no.
This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock.
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Yeah.
Watch out!
It's all right. It's all right.
Yeah, that's what I thought -- mynock.
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached ...
chewing on the power cables.
Mynocks?
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!
Wait a minute.
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!
No time to discuss this
in committee!
I am not a committee!
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.
- Look!
- I see it.
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.
- This is no cave.
- What?
Yes, run.
Yes.
A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression --
The dark side
of the Force are they.
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.
If once you start down
the dark path ...
forever will it dominate
your destiny.
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
Vader.
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.
Quicker, easier, more seductive.
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?
You will know ...
when you are calm,
at peace ...
passive.
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence ...
never for attack.
- But tell me why I can't --
- No. There is no why.
Nothing more
will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
There's something not right here.
I feel cold.
- Death.
- That place ...
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.
A domain of evil it is.
In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons ...
you will not need them.
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger.
Right.
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.
You are free to use
any methods necessary ...
but I want them alive.
No disintegrations.
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.
My lord, we have them.
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?
One, two ...
three!
It's not fair.
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.
Turn her around.
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving ...
a direct assault
on an imperial Star Destroyer--
Shut up!
They're moving to attack position.
Shields up.
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.
Get a shuttle ready.
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.
Use the Force.
Yes.
Now, the stone.
Feel it.
Concentrate!
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.
So certain are you.
Always with you
it cannot be done.
Hear you nothing that I say?
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.
This is totally different.
No. No different.
Only different in your mind.
You must unlearn
what you have learned.
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.
Do ...
or do not.
There is no try.
I can't. It's too big.
Size matters not.
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
And well you should not ...
for my ally is the Force.
And a powerful ally it is.
Life creates it ...
makes it grow.
Its energy surrounds us ...
and binds us.
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.
You must feel
the Force around you.
Here, between you, me ...
the tree, the rock --
everywhere.
Yes ...
even between
the land and the ship.
You want the impossible.
I don't believe it.
That is why you fail.
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.
If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed ...
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.
Alert all commands.
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again ...
Admiral.
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
The fleet's beginning to break up.
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.
I really don't see
how that's going to help.
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.
The Empire may be
gracious enough --
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?
If they follow standard
imperial procedure ...
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.
Any ideas?
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.
- Lando.
- Lando system?
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.
Card player, gambler.
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.
Lando conned somebody out of it.
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.
- Can you trust him?
- No.
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.
You do have your moments.
Not many of them,
but you do have them.
Concentrate.
Feel the Force flow.
Yes.
Good.
Calm.
Yes.
Through the Force,
things you will see.
Other places.
The future. The past.
Old friends long gone.
Control, control.
You must learn control.
I saw a city in the clouds.
Friends you have there.
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.
Future?
Will they die?
Difficult to see.
Always in motion is the future.
I've gotta go to them.
Decide you must
how to serve them best.
If you leave now,
help them you could ...
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.
No, I don't have a landing permit.
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!
You will not deviate
from your present course.
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
Permission granted to land
on Platform 327.
Thank you.
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.
Who's worried?
No one to meet us.
I don't like this.
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Trust me.
See? My friend.
Keep your eyes open.
Hey.
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.
Yes. Very friendly.
What are you doing here?
Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.
How you doin', Chewbacca?
Still hanging around with this loser?
Hello.
What have we here?
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.
- And who might you be?
- Leia.
Welcome, Leia.
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.
My facilities are at your --
Well, really!
- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.
I've had supply problems
of every kind.
I've had labour difficulties.
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.
Who'd have thought that, huh?
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.
It's the price you pay
for being successful.
Nice to see a familiar face.
How rude!
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.
I wonder if -- Hello?
How interesting.
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.
Luke, you must complete the training.
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.
You must not go.
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- You don't know that.
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.
But you cannot control it.
This is a dangerous time for you ...
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.
But I've learned
so much since then.
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.
You have my word.
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.
That's why I have to go.
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.
You won't.
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally ...
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.
If you end your training now ...
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did ...
you will become an agent of evil.
Patience.
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for ...
yes.
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.
I cannot interfere.
I understand.
R2, fire up the converters.
Don't give in to hate.
That leads to the dark side.
Strong is Vader.
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.
I will.
And I'll return. I promise.
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.
Now ...
matters are worse.
That boy is our last hope.
No, there is another.
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.
I don't trust Lando.
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.
Besides, we'll soon be gone.
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?
What happened?
Where?
Found him in a junk pile?
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
You look absolutely beautiful.
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.
Thank you.
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?
Everyone's invited, of course.
Having trouble with your droid?
No. No problem. Why?
You see, since we're
a small operation ...
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.
Which is advantageous
for everybody ...
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.
We would be honoured
if you would join us.
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
No, 3PO's with them.
Just hang on.
We're almost there.
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.
No, please don't get up.
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!
Lord Vader.
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt ...
after I have Skywalker.
He's no good to me dead.
He will not be
permanently damaged.
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?
They must never again leave this city.
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?
No.
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.
This deal is getting worse
all the time.
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.
Something's not right
because now I can't see.
That's much better.
Wait. Wait.
Oh, my!
What have you done?
I'm backwards!
You flea-bitten furball!
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough --
I feel terrible.
Why are they doing this?
They never even asked me
any questions.
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.
-And Han?
-Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?
My friend.
Stop!
I've done all I can.
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.
Yeah.
You're a real hero.
You certainly
have a way with people.
This facility is crude ...
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker ...
for his journey to the emperor.
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.
We will test it on Captain Solo.
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me ...
so don't do anything foolish.
What's going on, buddy?
You're being put into carbon freeze.
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.
Chewbacca, stop!
No, Chewie, stop!
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.
Chewie, this won't help me.
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.
The princess.
You have to take care of her.
Do you hear me?
- I love you.
- I know.
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.
They've encased him in carbonite.
He should be quite
well-protected ...
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
Yes, he's alive.
And in perfect hibernation.
He's all yours, bounty hunter.
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
Skywalker has just landed, lord.
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.
Calrissian ...
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.
I am altering the deal.
Pray I don't alter it any further.
Luke, don't! It's a trap!
It's a trap!
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.
But you are not a Jedi yet.
Well done.
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.
Move.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.
Do you think that
after what you did to Han --
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.
I'm just trying to help.
We don't need any of your help.
What?
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han ...
at the east ... platform.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he's only a Wookiee.
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.
R2, where have you been?
Wait. Turn around, you woolly --
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.
Look what's happened to me.
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!
You have learned much, young one.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
All too easy.
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.
Impressive.
Most impressive.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.
Now, release your anger.
Only your hatred can destroy me.
The security code
has been changed.
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.
R2, hurry.
Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.
The Empire has taken control
of the city.
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.
This way.
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Falcon. It's fixed!
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!
That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless -- Ow!
Go!
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.
Of course I've looked better.
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.
There is no escape.
Don't make me destroy you.
You do not yet realize
your importance.
You have only begun
to discover your power.
Join me ...
and I will complete your training.
With our combined strength ...
we can end
this destructive conflict ...
and bring order to the galaxy.
I'll never join you!
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.
He told me enough.
He told me you killed him.
I am your father.
That's not true.
That's impossible!
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.
It is your destiny.
Join me ...
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.
Come with me.
It is the only way.
Ben.
Ben, please.
Hear me.
- We've got to go back.
- What?
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?
Chewie, just do it.
All right, all right!
Alert my Star Destroyer
to prepare for my arrival.
Look, someone's up there.
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.
Okay. Easy, Chewie.
- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.
All right, Chewie. Let's go.
I'll be back.
Star Destroyer.
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.
Punch it!
They told me they fixed it.
I trusted them!
It's not my fault!
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?
We can't?
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?
The city's central computer told you?
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.
Father.
Son, come with me.
Ben.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's Vader.
Luke, it is your destiny.
Why didn't you tell me?
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!
You did it!
- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- Good luck, Lando.
When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.
Take care, you two.
May the Force be with you.

Command station,
this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.
Stand by.
You are clear to proceed.
We're starting our approach.
[Siren]
Inform the commander...
that Lord Vader's
shuttle has arrived.
Sir.
Lord Vader, this is
an unexpected pleasure.
We're honored by your presence.
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.
I'm here to put you
back on schedule.
I assure you,
Lord Vader...
my men are working
as fast as they can.
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.
I tell you this station
will be operational, as planned.
The emperor
does not share...
your optimistic appraisal
of the situation.
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.
The emperor's
coming here?
That is correct, Commander...
and he is most displeased...
with your apparent
lack of progress.
We shall
double our efforts.
I hope so, Commander,
for your sake.
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.
[Whistle Whistle Beep]
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be, too.
Lando Calrissian
and poor Chewbacca...
never returned
from this awful place.
[Beep Beep Whistle]
Don't be so sure.
If I told you half the things I've heard
about this Jabba the Hutt...
you'd probably
short-circuit.
[Whining]
[Whistle Whistle]
[Beep Whistle]
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?
[Whistle Beep Beep]
I'd better knock,
I suppose.
[Whistle]
There doesn't seem
to be anyone here.
Let's go back
and tell Master Luke.

R2, wait!
[Whistle]
Oh, dear!

R2, I really don't think we should
rush into all this.
[Beep Beep]
Oh! R2!
R2, wait for me!
[Whistle Beep]
Grr!

Grr!
Just you deliver
Master Luke's message...
and get us out of here.
Oh, my!
Oh!
Oh, no.

Oh, my!

I'm terribly sorry.
I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn
about these sort of things.
Noht cha!
R2, I have
a bad feeling about this.

Oohh!
Arf! Arf!
Arf! Arf!
Oohh!

Good morning.
Ohnt bat chuay

Oohh!
The message, R2,
the message.
Oohh shoodah.
[Whistle Whistle Beep]
Greetings, Exalted One.
Allow me
to introduce myself.
I am Luke Skywalker...
Jedi knight
and friend to Captain Solo.
I know that you
are powerful, mightyJabba...
and that your anger
with Solo...
must be equally powerful.
I seek an audience
with Your Greatness...
to bargain
for Solo's life.
Ha ha ha!
With your wisdom...
I'm sure that we can
work out an arrangement...
which will be
mutually beneficial...
and enable us to avoid any
unpleasant confrontation.
As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift...
these two droids.
What did he say?
Both are hardworking
and will serve you well.
This can't be!
R2, you're playing
the wrong message.
Ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha!
Master, bargonay
tua knight?
He's noJedi.
[Speaking Huttese]
There will be no bargain.
We're doomed.
[Speaking Huttese]
I will not give up my favorite decoration.
I like Captain Solo where he is.
R2, look...
Captain Solo.
And he's still
frozen in carbonite.
[Whistle]
Ah ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?
Was it something I did?
He never expressed
any unhappiness with my work.
Ohh! How horrid!
Ohh!
Grr!
Grr!
[Whistle Whistle]
Ah ah ah!
Ah ah ha!
Aaah!
Ah, good.
New acquisitions.
You are
a protocol droid...
are you not?
I am C-3PO...
Yes or no
will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages
do you speak?
I am fluent...
in over six million forms
of communication and can...
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...
and disintegrated him.
Disintegrated?
Aah!
Oh!
Guard!
This protocol droid
might be useful.
Fit him with
a restraining bolt...
and take him back up to His Excellency's
main audience chamber.
R2, don't leave me!
Oh!
[Whistle Beep Bleep]
You're a feisty
little one...
but you'll soon learn
some respect.
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...
and I think
you'll fill in nicely.
No! No! No!
Aaahh!
[Singing In Huttese]
[Speaking Huttese]
Ah! Do that again!
[Singing In Huttese]
[Singing In Huttese]
Ho ho!
Aah!

Ooahhh!

[Speaking Ubese]
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
Oh, no. Chewbacca!
Aarrrrr.
[Speaking Huttese]
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
Kanji ta, droid.
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.
Yes?
[Speaking Huttese]
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...
and will gladly pay you...
the reward of 25,000.
[Speaking Ubese]
I want 50,000. No less.
50,000. No less.
Wah! Aah!
Ohh!
[Speaking Huttese]
What... What did I say?
[Speaking Huttese]
The mightyJabba asks
why he must pay 50,000.
[Speaking Ubese]
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator!
Oh!
Aah!
Rrrrrr!
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
[Speaking Huttese]
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum...
fearless and inventive.
[Speaking Huttese]
Jabba offers
the sum of 35...
and I do suggest
you take it.
[Speaking Ubese]
He agrees!
Arrrr!
Grrr!
[Playing Festive Tune]
Ahh!
[Speaking Huttese]
[Speaking Ubese]
Rrr!
Arrrr!

[Clink Clink]
[Thud]
Just relax
for a moment.
You're free
of the carbonite.
Shh. You have
hibernation sickness.
I can't see.
Your eyesight
will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
Someone
who loves you.
Leia.
I got to get you
out of here.
Ho ho ho ho ho!
What's that?
Ho ho ho ho ho!
I know that laugh.
[Speaking Huttese]
Hey, Jabba...
Look, Jabba...
I was just on my way
to pay you back...
and I got a little
sidetracked.
It's not my fault.
[Speaking Huttese]
It's too late for that, Solo.
You may have been a good smuggler...
but now you're Bantha fodder.
Ah ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Look...
Take him away.
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.
You're throwing
away a fortune!
Don't be a fool!
[Jabba Speaking Huttese]
Bring her to me.
We have
powerful friends.
You're going
to regret this.
I'm sure.
[Slurp]
Ugh!
Oh, I can't bear
to watch.
Oh! Ah ha ha ha!
Arrrrg.
Chewie?
Arrrr!
Chewie,
is that you?
Rarrr!
Ch-Chewie!
I can't see, pal.
What's going on?
Ar grr arr.
Luke? Luke's crazy.
He can't even take
care of himself...
much less
rescue anybody.
Arrr rarrr.
AJedi knight?
I'm out of it
for a little while...
everybody gets
delusions of grandeur.
Arrra!
I'm all right, pal.
Arrrrrrr.
I'm all right.
Grrr!
Grrr!
Arg.
Yo macka chipowan
Skywalker.
Jabba mo botowa tu.
I must speak
with Jabba.
Es tosit.
Jabba no tusen

No bargain.
You will take me
toJabba now.
Ataka bu Jabba now.
You serve
your master well.
Ay sota vanlocha.
And you will
be rewarded.
A chunoh ayo ahtot.
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.
Master.
Oohh!
Gabba nopez Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight.
[Speaking Huttese]
I told you not to admit him.
I must be allowed
to speak.
[Speaking Huttese]
He must be allowed to speak.
You weak-minded fool!
Eee! Ah!
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.
Ho ho ho ho ho!
[Speaking Huttese]
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
Nevertheless...
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.
You can either
profit by this...
or be destroyed.
It's your choice...
but I warn you not to
underestimate my powers.
Ooahh.
Master Luke,
you're standing on...
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.
I shall enjoy watching you die.
Grr!
Ho ho ho!
TibiJedi!
TibiJedi!
[Creaking]
Oh, no! The rancor!
Grr!
[Squealing]
[Squealing]
Grr!
[Squealing]
[Crunch]
Ha ha ha!
Grr!
Grrr!
Oh!
Whoo-hoo!
Grr!
Ya! Ha!
Ah ha ha!
Grr!
[Crunch]
[Speaking Huttese]
[Whining]
[Speaking Huttese]
[Speaking Huttese]
[Speaking Huttese]
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.
They will all suffer for this outrage.
Han!
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine.
Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
Same as always.
That bad, huh?
Where's Leia?
I'm here.
[Speaking Huttese]
[C-3PO]
Oh, dear.
His High Exaltedness,
the greatJabba the Hutt...
has decreed that you are to
be terminated immediately.
Good.
I hate long waits.
Oh ah ha ha ha ha!
You will therefore
be taken to the Dune Sea...
and cast into
the Pit of Carkoon...
the nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
Doesn't sound so bad.
In his belly,
you will find...
a new definition
of pain and suffering...
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.
Aaarrrr!
On second thought,
let's pass on that.
You should have
bargained.
[Speaking Huttese]
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
[Band Playing Festive Tune]
I think my eyes
are getting better.
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here,
you know.
You're going to die here,
you know.
Convenient.
Just stick close
to Chewie and Lando.
I've taken care
of everything.
Oh. Great.
Aah!
Ow!
[Speaking Huttese]
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
[Beep Whistle]
I'm terribly sorry.
R2, what are you
doing here?
[Bleep Beep]
Well, I can see
you're serving drinks...
but this place
is dangerous.
They're going to
execute Master Luke...
and, if we're not
careful, us, too.
[Beep Beep]
Hmmph! I wish I had
your confidence.
Grrrr!
Arrr.
[Speaking Huttese]
[C-3PO]
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honorably.
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...
the greatJabba the Hutt...
will now listen
to your pleas.
[Beep Beep Whistle]
TibiJedi.
3PO, you tell
that slimy piece...
of worm-ridden filth...
he'll get no such
pleasure from us!
Right?
Grr!
[Luke]
Jabba...
this is
your last chance.
Free us or die.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Speaking Huttese]
Move him into position.
[Beep Beep]
Put him in.
Aah!
Grr!
Easy, Chewie.
Help!
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?
Han! Chewie!
Lando!
Boba Fett?
Boba Fett? Where?
Eeyaah!
Uhh!
[Burp]
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
I'm trying!
Augghh!
[Death Rattle]
- Grab me, Chewie.
- I'm slipping!
Grab it! Almost...
You almost got it.
Gently, now.
All right. Easy, easy.
Hold me, Chewie.
Eeyaah!
Chewie!
Chewie,
give me the gun.
Don't move, Lando.
Wait! I thought
you were blind!
It's all right!
I can see a lot better!
Don't move!
A little higher!
Just a little higher!
Chewie, pull us up.
Up, Chewie. Up.
Come on. We gotta
get out of here.
Not my eyes! R2, help!
Quickly, R2!
Beast!
Eh heh. Boo ba daba da!
Get the gun!
Point it at the deck!
Point it at the deck!
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly go...
Aah!
[Whistle]
Come on!
Let's go.
And don't forget
the droids.
We're on our way.
[Beep Whistle Whistle]
[Whistle]
I'll meet you
back at the fleet.
[Leia]
Hurry.
The Alliance should
be assembled by now.
I will.
[Han]
Hey, Luke, thanks.
Thanks for coming
after me.
Now I owe you one.
[Whistle Beep]
That's right, R2.
We're going
to the Dagobah system.
[Whistle]
I have a promise to keep...
to an old friend.
Rise, my friend.
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.
You've done well,
Lord Vader.
And now I sense
you wish to continue...
your search for
young Skywalker.
Yes, my master.
Patience, my friend.
In time,
he will seek you out.
And when he does...
you must bring him
before me.
He has grown strong.
Only together
can we turn him...
to the dark side
of the Force.
As you wish.
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.
Ha ha ha ha!
[Beep Whistle]
That face
you make...
Look I so old
to young eyes?
No, of course not.
I do.
Yes, I do.
Sick have I become.
Old and weak.
When 900 years old
you reach...
Iook as good
you will not, hmm?
Heh heh heh.
Soon will I rest.
Yes.
Forever sleep.
Earned it I have.
Master Yoda,
you can't die.
Strong am I
with the Force...
but not that strong.
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.
That is the way of things...
the way of the Force.
But I need your help.
I've come back to
complete the training.
No more training
do you require.
Already know you
that which you need.
Then I am a Jedi.
Oh!
[Laughs, Coughs]
Not yet.
One thing remains...
Vader.
You must confront Vader.
Then, only then,
a Jedi will you be.
And confront him
you will.
Master Yoda...
is Darth Vader
my father?
Rest I need.
Yes.
Rest.
Yoda, I must know.
Your father he is.
Told you, did he?
Yes.
Unexpected this is.
And unfortunate.
Unfortunate that
I know the truth?
No.
Unfortunate that you
rushed to face him...
that incomplete
was your training...
that not ready for
the burden were you.
I'm sorry.
Remember...
a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.
But beware...
Anger, fear...
aggression...
the dark side are they.
Once you start
down the dark path...
forever will it
dominate your destiny.
Luke...
Luke...
do not...
do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...
or suffer your
father's fate you will.
Luke...
when gone am I...
the last of theJedi
will you be.
Luke...
the Force runs strong
in your family.
Pass on what
you have learned.
Luke...
there is...
another...
Sk...
Sky... walker.
[Beep Beep]
I can't do it, R2.
[Beep Whistle]
I can't go on alone.
Yoda will always
be with you.
Obi-Wan.
Why didn't you
tell me?
You told me Vader...
betrayed and murdered my father.
Your father was seduced by
the dark side of the Force.
He ceased to be
Anakin Skywalker...
and became Darth Vader.
When that happened...
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.
So what I told you
was true...
from a certain
point of view.
A certain
point of view?
Luke, you're
going to find...
that many of the truths
we cling to...
depend greatly
on our own point of view.
Anakin was
a good friend.
When I first knew him...
your father was
already a great pilot...
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.
I was wrong.
There is still
good in him.
He's more machine now
than man...
twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape
your destiny.
You must face
Darth Vader again.
I can't kill
my own father.
Then the emperor
has already won.
You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.
But I have no sister.
To protect you both
from the emperor...
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.
The emperor knew,
as I did...
if Anakin were
to have any offspring...
they would be
a threat to him.
That is the reason...
why your sister remains
safely anonymous.
Leia!
Leia's my sister.
Your insight
serves you well.
Bury your feelings
deep down, Luke.
They do you credit...
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.
Well, look at you...
a general, huh?
Someone must have told them
about my little maneuver...
at the Battle ofTanaab.
Well, don't look at me, pal.
I just said
you were a fair pilot.
I didn't know they were
looking for somebody...
to lead
this crazy attack.
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.
You're the respectable
one, remember?
[Chimes]
The emperor's
made a critical error...
and the time for our attack
has come.
The data brought to us
by the Bothan spies...
pinpoint the exact location...
of the emperor's
new battle station.
We also know that the weapon systems
of this Death Star...
are not yet operational.
With the imperial fleet...
spread throughout
the galaxy...
in a vain effort
to engage us...
it is relatively
unprotected.
But most important of all...
we've learned
that the emperor himself...
is personally overseeing
the final stages...
of the construction
of this Death Star.
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.
Admiral Ackbar, please.
You can see here
the Death Star...
orbiting the forest moon
of Endor.
Although the weapon systems
on this Death Star...
are not yet operational...
the Death Star does have
a strong defense mechanism.
It is protected
by an energy shield...
which is generated...
from the nearby forest moon
of Endor.
The shield
must be deactivated...
if any attack
is to be attempted.
Once the shield is down...
our cruisers
will create a perimeter...
while the fighters fly
into the superstructure...
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.
Good luck.
You're going
to need it.
General Madine.
We have stolen
a small imperial shuttle.
Disguised as a cargo ship...
and using
a secret imperial code...
a strike team
will land on the moon...
and deactivate
the shield generator.
[C-3PO]
Sounds dangerous.
I wonder who they found
to pull that off.
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?
Uh, my team's ready.
I don't have a command crew
for the shuttle.
Arrr!
It's going to be rough, pal.
I didn't wanna speak for you.
Arr!
That's one.
General...
count me in.
I'm with you, too.
What is it?
Ask me again sometime.
Luke.
Hi, Han, Chewie.
[Whistle]
"Exciting" is hardly
the word I would choose.
Look, I want you
to take her.
I mean it. Take her.
You need all the help
you can get.
She's the fastest
ship in the fleet.
All right, old buddy.
I know what
she means to you.
I'll take
good care of her.
She won't
get a scratch.
All right?
Right.
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.
Would you get going,
you pirate?
Good luck.
You, too.
Got her warmed?
She's coming up.
Arr!
Yeah, well, I don't think
the Empire had Wookiees in mind...
when they designed her,
Chewie.
Hey, you awake?
Yeah. I just got
a funny feeling...
like I'm not
gonna see her again.
Come on, General,
let's move.
Right. Chewie, let's see what
this piece of junk can do.
Ready, everybody?
All set.
[Whistle]
Here we go again.
All right, hang on.
What is thy bidding,
my master?
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.
There it will stay
until called for.
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?
It is of no concern.
Soon the rebellion
will be crushed...
and young Skywalker
will be one of us.
Your work here is finished,
my friend.
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.
Yes, my master.
If they don't
go for this...
we're gonna have to get out
of here pretty quick, Chewie.
Arrrr!
[Radio]
We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.
Shuttle Tydirium
requesting deactivation...
of the deflector shield.
Shuttle Tydirium...
transmit the clearance code
for shield passage.
Transmission commencing.
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.
It'll work. It'll work.
Vader's on that ship.
Now, don't
get jittery, Luke.
There are a lot
of command ships.
Keep your distance,
though, Chewie...
but don't look like you're trying
to keep your distance.
Arrrr?!
I don't know.
Fly casual.
Where is
that shuttle going?
Shuttle Tydirium, what is
your cargo and destination?
Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.
Do they have
a code clearance?
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.
I was about to clear them.
I'm endangering
the mission.
I shouldn't have come.
It's your imagination, kid.
Let's keep a little
optimism here.
Shall I hold them?
No.
Leave them to me.
I will deal
with them myself.
As you wish, my lord.
Carry on.
They're not going
for it, Chewie.
Shuttle Tydirium...
deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.
Follow your present course.
O.K. I told you
it was going to work.
No problem.
Oh, I told you
it was dangerous here!
Should we try
and go around?
It'll take time.
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.
Arr!
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.
Hey, it's me.
[Snap]
Go for help! Go!
Great. Come on!
Over there!
Two more of them.
I see them.
Wait, Leia!
Hey, wait!
Quick.
Jam their comlink!
Center switch!
Move closer!
Get alongside that one!
Oh!
Keep on that one!
I'll take these two!
Aah!
Aah!
[Whistle Beep Beep]
General Solo,
somebody's coming.
Urrr!
Oh!
Luke!
Arrr!
Where's Leia?
She didn't come back?
I thought she was
with you.
We got separated.
We better go look for her.
Take the squad ahead.
We'll meet at the shield
generator at 0300.
[Luke] Come on, R2,
we'll need your scanners.
Don't worry,
Master Luke.
We know what to do.
And you said
it was pretty here.
Eek.
Eek!
Cut it out!
Grrrrr.
Rrrr.
[Speaking Ewokese]
Arrr. Arrr.
I'm not
going to hurt you.
Oh.
[Speaking Ewokese]
Well, looks like
I'm stuck here.
Trouble is,
I don't know where here is.
Maybe you can help me.
Come on. Sit down.
Grrrrr.
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.
Grrrrr!
All right. You want
something to eat?
[Speaking Ewokese]
That's right.
- Come on.
- [Speaking Ewokese]
Hmm?
[Sniff Sniff]
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
Ya! Yee!
[Speaking Ewokese]
Look. It's a hat.
It's not going
to hurt you. Look.
Arrr.
[Speaking Ewokese]
You're a jittery
little thing, aren't you?
Ooooh!
[Sniff Sniff]
What is it?
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Sniff Sniff Sniff]
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Zap]
Oh!
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
Freeze!
Come on, get up!
Grrrrr!
Go get your ride.
Take her back to base.
Yes, sir.
Rrrooh!
What the...
Ya!
[Speaking Ewokese]
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
[Speaking Ewokese]
I told you to remain
on the command ship.
A small rebel force...
has penetrated
the shield...
and landed on Endor.
Yes, I know.
My son is with them.
[Emperor]
Are you sure?
I have felt him,
my master.
Strange that I have not.
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear...
Lord Vader.
They are clear,
my master.
Then you must go to the sanctuary moon
and wait for him.
He will come to me?
I have foreseen it.
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.
He will come to you...
and then you will
bring him before me.
As you wish.
Luke! Luke!
Oh, Master Luke.
Arrrrr.
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.
And I found this.
I'm afraid
that R2's sensors...
can find no trace
of Princess Leia.
I hope she's all right.
Arrrrr!
Arrrrr!
What, Chewie?
Arrrrr!
What, Chewie?
Arrrrrrrr.
Arrrr.
Arrr.
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal, Chewie.
Chewie, wait!
Don't!
Aah!
[Han]
Nice work.
Arrrrr!
Great, Chewie.
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.
Take it easy.
Let's just figure a way...
to get out
of this thing.
Han, can you reach
my lightsaber?
Yeah. Sure.
[Whistle Beep Beep]
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.
It's a very long drop!
Ah.
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
What...
Hey! Point that thing
someplace else.
[Arguing In Ewokese]
Hey!
Han, don't.
It'll be all right.
[Speaking Ewokese]
Chewie, give them
your crossbow.
Arrrrr!
Oh, my head!
[Speaking Ewokese]
Oh, my goodness.
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Chanting In Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
Do you understand
anything they're saying?
Oh, yes, Master Luke.
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...
What are you
telling them?
Hello, I think.
I could be mistaken.
They're using a very
primitive dialect.
I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.
[Beep Beep]
Haaaar!
Why don't you use
your divine influence...
and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?
It's against
my programming...
to impersonate a deity.
Why, you...
[Ewoks Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
My mistake.
He's an old friend
of mine.
Jabba jabba jabba.
Ow!
Hey!
[Squeak]
Rrrr.
Arrrr!
I have a really bad
feeling about this.
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
What did he say?
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...
but it appears you are to be
the main course...
at a banquet in my honor.
Arrrrr!
[Singing In Ewokese]
Leia!
Leia!
[Speaking Ewokese]
Your Royal Highness.
But these are my friends.
[Singing In Ewokese]
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.
Arrrrr!
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
Eee! Ya! Ya! Ya!
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.
3PO, tell them if they
don't do as you wish...
you'll become angry
and use your magic.
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly.
Just tell them.
[Speaking Ewokese]
Boom!
[Speaking Ewokese]
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...
just as I said
they wouldn't.
Wait, wait.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Eee!
Put me down!
Help! Somebody!
Somebody, help!
Master Luke!
R2, R2, quickly!
Oh! Oh!
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Beep Beep Whistle]
Oh!
Aah!
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
Thank goodness.

Just what
I always wanted.
[Beep Beep Beep]
Short help's better
than no help at all.
He says the scouts
are going to show us...
the quickest way
to the shield generator.
How far is it?
Ask him.
We need some
fresh supplies, too.
[Speaking Ewokese]
Try and get
our weapons back.
[Speaking Ewokese]
Hurry up, will you?
I haven't got all day.
Luke, what's wrong?
Leia, do you remember
your mother...
your real mother?
Just a little bit.
She died when
I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
She was...
very beautiful.
Kind... but sad.
Why are you
asking me this?
I have no memory
of my mother.
I never knew her.
Luke, tell me...
what's troubling you?
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.
How do you know?
I felt his presence.
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.
That's why I have to go.
As long as I stay...
I'm endangering the group
and our mission here.
I have to face him.
Why?
He's my father.
Your father?
There's more.
It won't be easy for you to hear it,
but you must.
If I don't make it back...
you're the only hope
for the Alliance.
Don't talk that way.
You have a power
I don't understand...
and could never have.
You're wrong, Leia.
You have
that power, too.
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.
The Force is strong
in my family.
My father has it.
I have it.
And...
my sister has it.
Yes.
It's you, Leia.
I know.
Somehow...
I've always known.
Then you know why
I have to face him.
No! Luke, run away.
Far away.
If he can feel
your presence...
then leave this place.
I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't.
You've always
been strong.
But why must you
confront him?
Because...
there is good in him.
I've felt it.
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.
I can save him.
I can turn him back
to the good side.
I have to try.
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing.
I just want to be alone
for a little while.
Nothing?
Come on, tell me.
What's going on?
I...
I can't tell you.
Could you tell Luke?
Is that
who you could tell?
I...
Ah.
I'm sorry.
Hold me.
This is the rebel
that surrendered to us.
Although he denies it, I believe
there may be more of them...
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.
He was armed
only with this.
Good work, Commander.
Leave us.
Conduct your search...
and bring
his companions to me.
Yes, my lord.
The emperor
has been expecting you.
I know, Father.
So, you have accepted the truth.
I've accepted the truth...
that you were once
Anakin Skywalker, my father.
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.
I know there is good
in you.
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.
That was why you
couldn't destroy me.
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.
Your skills are complete.
Indeed you are powerful...
as the emperor has foreseen.
Come with me.
Obi-Wan once thought
as you do.
You don't know the power
of the dark side.
I must obey my master.
I will not turn...
and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.
It is too late for me, son.
The emperor will show you...
the true nature of the Force.
He is your master now.
Then my father is truly dead.
Urrr.
The main entrance
to the control bunker...
is on the far side
of that landing platform.
This isn't going
to be easy.
Hey, don't worry.
Chewie and me got into
a lot of places...
more heavily guarded
than this.
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Leia]
What's he saying?
He says
there's a secret entrance...
on the other side
of the ridge.
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.
Proceed with the countdown.
All groups
assume attack coordinates.
[Speaking Alien Language]
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.
He'll have that shield down on time.
[Speaking Alien Language]
Or this will be
the shortest offensive of all time.
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.
All right. Stand by.
[Whistle]
[Speaking Ewokese]
Back door, huh?
Good idea.
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
It's only
a few guards.
This shouldn't be
too much trouble.
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
It only takes one
to sound the alarm.
Then we'll do it
real quiet like.
Oh, my!
Princess Leia!
I'm afraid
our furry companion...
has gone and done
something rather rash.
Rrrrooohh.
Oh, no.
[Han] There goes our
surprise attack.
[Starts Engine]
Look, over there!
Stop him!
Not bad for
a little furball.
There's only one left.
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.
I have decided...
that we shall
stay here.
Whoo-whoo!
Yahoo!
Whoo whoo!
Wa ha ha ha!
Wa ha ha ha!
Hey!
Yoooaww!
Ooohm.
Welcome, young Skywalker.
I have been expecting you.
You'll no longer need those.
Guards, leave us.
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.
In time,
you will call me master.
You're gravely mistaken.
You won't convert me
as you did my father.
Oh, no, my young Jedi.
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...
about a great many things.
[Vader]
His lightsaber.
Ah, yes. AJedi's weapon.
Much like your father's.
By now you must know...
your father
can never be turned...
from the dark side.
So will it be with you.
You're wrong.
Soon I'll be dead,
and you with me.
Ha ha ha ha!
Perhaps you refer
to the imminent attack...
of your rebel fleet.
Yes.
I assure you...
we are quite safe
from your friends here.
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.
Your faith
in your friends is yours.
[Vader]
It is pointless to resist, my son.
Everything that has transpired...
has done so
according to my design.
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.
It was I
who allowed the Alliance...
to know the location
of the shield generator.
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.
Oh...
I'm afraid
the deflector shield...
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.
All right, up!
Move! Come on.
Quickly. Quickly.
Chewie.
Grr!
Han, hurry!
The fleet will
be here any moment.
Charges!
Come on, come on!
Oh, my!
They'll be captured!
[Speaking Ewokese]
Wait! Wait!
Come back!
[Speaking Ewokese]
R2, stay with me.
Freeze!
Aah!
You rebel scum.
Uhh waahh!
Uhh!
Ahh yaa!
All wings report in.
Red Leader standing by.
Gray Leader
standing by.
Green Leader standing by.
Lock S-foils
in attack positions.
May the Force be with us.
[Speaking Alien Language]
We've got to
get a reading...
on that shield.
[Speaking Alien Language]
How could they
be jamming us...
if they don't know...
if we're coming.
Break off the attack!
The shield is still up.
I get no reading.
You sure?
Pull up!
All craft pull up!
Take evasive action.
Green Group,
stick to Holding Sector MV-7.
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.
It's a trap!
Fighters coming in!
There's too many of them!
Accelerate
to attack speed.
Draw their fire away
from the cruisers.
Copy, Gold Leader.
Come, boy.
See for yourself.
From here,
you will witness...
the final destruction
of the Alliance...
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.
You want this...
don't you?
The hate is swelling in you now.
Take yourJedi weapon.
Use it.
I am unarmed.
Strike me down with it.
Give in to your anger.
With each passing moment...
you make yourself
more my servant.
No.
It is unavoidable.
It is your destiny.
You, like your father...
are now...
mine.
All right, move it!
Keep moving.
Come on.
Hello!
I say, over there!
Were you looking
for me?
Grr!
Bring those two
down here.
Well, they're
on their way.
R2, are you sure
this was a good idea?
Freeze!
Don't move!
We surrender.
- Aiyee!
- Haa!
Whoo! Whoo!
- Aiyee!
- Yaah!
- Aiyee!
- Haa!
The code's changed.
We need R2.
Here's the terminal.
R2, where are you? We need you
at the bunker right away.
What do you mean,
you're going?
[Bleep Boop]
Going where, R2?
No, wait!
This is no time for heroics!
Come back!
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.
Red 3, Red 2, pull in.
Got it.
Three of them coming in,
20 degrees.
Cut to the left.
I'll take the leader.
They're heading
for the medical frigate.
Pressure steady.
Only the fighters
are attacking.
I wonder what those
Stardestroyers are waiting for.
We're in attack position, sir.
Hold here.
We're not going to attack?
I have my orders
from the emperor himself.
He has something special
planned for them.
We only need to
keep them from escaping.
As you can see,
my young apprentice...
your friends have failed.
Now witness the firepower...
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.
Fire at will, Commander.
Fire.
Oh!
That blast came
from the Death Star.
That thing's operational!
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.
All craft prepare to retreat.
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.
We have no choice,
General Calrissian.
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.
Han will have
that shield down.
We've got to give him more time.
We're coming!
Aah!
Come on, come on!
Oh, R2, hurry!
Yeeoooww!
Oh, my goodness!
[Blip Blip Beep Beep]
Why did you
have to be so brave?
Eeooow...
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.
I'll cover you.
[Speaking Ewokese]
[Speaking Ewokese]
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can
and engage those Stardestroyers...
at point-blank range!
At that close range,
we won't last long...
against those Stardestroyers.
We'll last longer than
we will against that Death Star!
And we might just
take a few of them with us.
She's going to blow!
I'm hit!
Your fleet is lost...
and your friends
on the Endor moon...
will not survive.
There is no escape...
my young apprentice.
The Alliance will die...
as will your friends.
Good.
I can feel your anger.
I am defenseless.
Take your weapon.
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...
and your journey
towards the dark side...
will be complete!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
[Speaking Ewokese]
Ah... eeyaheeyah...
eeyaheeyah!
Look!
Get him
off of there!
Aaah!
Yahoo!
Yeeha! Yaaa!
Yeehaha!
I think I got it.
I got it!
Aah!
Princess Leia,
are you all right?
Let's see.
It's not bad.
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.
Don't move!
I love you.
I know.
Hands up!
Stand up!
Stay back.
Arrr!
Chewie!
Get down here!
She's wounded!
No, wait!
I got an idea.
Good.
Use your aggressive
feelings, boy.
Let the hate
flow through you.
Obi-Wan has
taught you well.
I will not fight you, Father.
You are unwise
to lower your defenses.
Your thoughts
betray you, Father.
I feel the good in you,
the conflict.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before.
I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.
You underestimate...
the power of the dark side.
If you will not fight...
then you will meet
your destiny.
[Emperor]
Good. Good.
Watch out!
Squad at.06.
I'm on it,
Gold Leader.
Good shot, Red 2.
We're sure in the middle
of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy,
don't let me down.
It's over, Commander.
The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing into the woods.
We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.
Send three squads to help.
Open the back door.
Throw me another charge.
You cannot
hide forever, Luke.
[Luke]
I will not fight you.
Give yourself
to the dark side.
It is the only way
you can save your friends.
Yes.
Your thoughts betray you.
Your feelings
for them are strong...
especially for...
sister.
So...
you have a twin sister.
Your feelings have
now betrayed her, too.
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.
Now his failure is complete.
If you will not turn
to the dark side...
then perhaps she will.
Never!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Good!
Your hate
has made you powerful.
Now...
fulfill your destiny...
and take your father's place
at my side.
Never.
I'll never turn
to the dark side.
You've failed, Your Highness.
I am a Jedi...
like my father before me.
So be it...
Jedi.
Move!
Move!
The shield is down!
Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor!
We're on our way.
Red Group, Gold Group,
all fighters follow me.
I told you they'd do it!
If you will not be turned...
you will be destroyed.
Young fool.
Only now, at the end...
do you understand.
Your feeble skills
are no match...
for the power
of the dark side.
Aaah!
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.
Aaah!
Father, please!
Ow! Aaah!
Help me!
Aaah!
Now, young Skywalker...
you will die.
Aahh!
Ow! Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaaahhhhh!
[Labored Breathing]
I'm going in.
Here goes nothing.
Now lock onto
the strongest power source.
It should be
the power generator.
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out
of space real fast.
Split up and head back
to the surface.
See if you can get a few
of those TI E fighters to follow you.
Copy, Gold Leader.
That was too close.
We've got to give
those fighters more time.
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.
Intensify
the forward batteries.
I don't want anything
to get through!
Intensify forward firepower!
Aaah!
Too late!
[Cheering And Applause]
Luke.
Help me take
this mask off.
But you'll die.
Nothing can stop that now.
Just for once...
let me look on you
with my own eyes.
Now...
go, my son.
Leave me.
No. You're coming with me.
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.
You already have, Luke.
You were right.
You were right about me.
Tell your sister...
you were right.
Father.
I won't leave you.
There it is.
All right, Wedge, go for
the power regulator on the north tower.
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.
Yee-ha!
Yah.
- Yaaa!
- Ya!
[Beep! Beep! Beep!]
They did it!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing
when it blew.
He wasn't.
I can feel it.
You love him.
Don't you?
Yes.
All right.
I understand.
Fine.
When he comes back...
I won't get in the way.
It's not like that at all.
He's my brother.
[Speaking Ewokese]
Wesa free!
[Singing In Ewokese]
