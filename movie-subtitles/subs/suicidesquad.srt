2
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,702
- Chow time!
- It's time!

3
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:48,246
Floyd, step up to the door. 
Dinner time.

4
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,660
Only my friends call me Floyd.

5
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:55,619
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

6
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:58,799
What's that?

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,999
- That is called loaf.
- Loaf.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,585
It's got a little bit of pasghetti
in there.

9
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,485
Toenails.

10
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:06,599
Rat shit.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,136
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,519
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,579
Yeah.

14
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,239
One day,

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,079
somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,892
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the Holy Ghost.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,580
Man, you just threatened a staff member.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,999
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you have.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,464
Do something.

20
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,478
Let's have some fun.

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,783
Open the goddamn gate!

22
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:05,320
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,375
Sector C! Pull your heads outta your ass!
Boss is on deck!

24
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:12,477
Open!

25
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:14,159
Bravo 14, open perimeter fence.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,399
Stay back!

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,368
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,056
You gonna come down from there or what?

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,255
Look at you.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,279
You know the rules, hotness.

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,799
You gotta keep off these bars.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,501
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,891
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,453
You are really
in bad shape upstairs, lady!

35
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,555
Gonna come in here and tell me that?

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,802
Or are you too scared?

37
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:47,599
Come on, I'm bored.

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,262
I'm bored. Play with me.

39
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,527
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.

40
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:53,780
No one's gonna play with you.

41
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,439
You sleep on the ground.

42
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:59,920
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,099
Oh, man. I love you.

44
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:05,157
Alpha One, hit her.

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,771
Come on, man. You're
six foot four. She's a tiny little girl.

46
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:13,199
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

47
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,999
We got chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,479
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

49
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,126
Ahh!

50
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,890
Spring break!

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,460
Whoo.

52
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,389
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,436
The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.

54
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,837
And then it changed again when he didn't.

55
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,811
And that is why I'm here.

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,719
We lose a national hero,

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,279
but you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,537
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

59
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,430
It's taken some work.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,410
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

61
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:51,375
There's rumors, Amanda,
that some of them have abilities.

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,399
Well, the rumors are right.

63
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,023
You know what the problem
with a metahuman is?

64
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:57,455
The human part.

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,839
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

66
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,362
The next Superman might not.

67
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,999
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,239
I'm fighting fire with fire.

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,678
You're not going to pitch us that

70
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:10,559
Task Force X project
of yours again, are you?

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,959
Yes.

72
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,147
But this time, you're gonna listen.

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,862
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,460
He's the most wanted hitman in the world.

75
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:44,526
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

76
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,759
- What?
- Hey, Angelo.

77
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,039
This is the exterminator
you called for your rat problem.

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,684
My account's looking a little thin.

79
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,735
No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.

80
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,713
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.

81
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,658
Whoa. 
Here's your boy right now.

82
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,681
With about 20 of his new best friends.

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,719
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

84
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,529
Listen, stop being cute and do your job!

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,919
They're taking him
outta the car now.

86
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,119
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

87
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,087
Okay. Okay, okay. Relax.
There was an accounting error.

88
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:26,671
We sent it.

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,719
Now double it for being a dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

90
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,719
We're not the kind of people
you play with.

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,679
Did you just... Did you threaten me?

92
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,639
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

93
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,842
You son of a bitch.

94
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,616
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

95
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:04,039
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

96
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:07,279
His is an 11 -year-old honor student
in Gotham City.

97
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,780
His daughter.

98
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,319
So we watched her and waited.

99
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,412
You should talk to Mama more.

100
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,999
Yeah, yeah, I know.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,959
Mama stays in bed a lot.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,279
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

103
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,011
Dad, it's okay. I can take care of her.

104
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,639
I know how to make pancakes now.

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,679
Hey, babe, that's beautiful.

106
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,759
Um, she's supposed to be
taking care of you.

107
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,020
You know, that's how
that's supposed to work.

108
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,017
I want you to come live with me.

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,279
All right? I came into some resources.
I'mma get us a spot.

110
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,199
It's gonna be nice, all right?

111
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,976
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.

112
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
That's not true.
That's a lie. She's lying to you.

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,772
Daddy... I know you do bad things.

114
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,770
Don't worry, I still love you.

115
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,049
Come on.

116
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,959
- And you caught him?
- Not me.

117
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,239
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham City.

118
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,857
I'mma figure this out. All right?

119
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,820
It's over, Deadshot.

120
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,140
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.

121
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,450
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

122
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,250
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

123
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,569
Please.

124
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,940
Don't do it.

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,460
All right.

126
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,973
Love you, Daddy.

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,959
So now we have the man who never misses.

128
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,119
Where'd you put him?

129
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,980
Let's just say, I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,535
Harley Quinn.

131
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,719
Before she ran off
and joined the circus,

132
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,319
she was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

133
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,095
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.

134
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,839
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

135
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,217
Dr. Quinzel.

136
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,740
You know,
I live for these moments with you.

137
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,170
- What do you got?
- I got you a kitty.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,319
So thoughtful.

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,096
She thought she was curing him,
but she was falling in love.

140
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,479
There is something
you could do for me, doctor.

141
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,980
Anything. I mean, yeah.

142
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,376
I need a machine gun.

143
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,695
A machine gun?

144
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,574
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

145
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,088
Get off me.

146
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,020
Shh!

147
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,410
What do we have here?

148
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,999
I did everything you said. I helped you.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Ah.

150
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,559
You helped me.

151
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,159
By erasing my mind?

152
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,255
What few faded memories I had.

153
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,375
No.

154
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,719
You left me in a black hole
of rage and confusion.

155
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,279
Is that the medicine
you practice, Dr. Quinzel?

156
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,399
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

157
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,219
What?

158
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,412
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

159
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,839
I'm just gonna hurt ya

160
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,159
really, really bad.

161
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,660
You think so?

162
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,251
Well, I can take it.

163
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,799
I wouldn't want you to break
those perfect porcelain-capped teeth

164
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,133
when the juice hits your brain.

165
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,879
They became the king
and queen of Gotham City.

166
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,372
And God help anyone
who disrespected the queen.

167
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,199
We finally meet.

168
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,479
Nah, he don't shake hands.

169
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,448
But sit down and have a drink.

170
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,039
Hey, J.

171
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,559
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

172
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,279
I wanted to come by
and personally say thank you.

173
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,374
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

174
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,135
Are you sweet talking me?

175
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,051
I love this guy.

176
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,970
He's so intense!

177
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,137
Mmm. You're a lucky man.

178
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,337
You got a bad bitch.

179
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,458
Oh, that she is.

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,016
The fire in my loins.

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,319
The itch in my crotch.

182
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,689
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

183
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,616
Oh, come to Daddy.

184
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,978
Puddin'!

185
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,479
Listen,

186
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,799
you are my gift
to this handsome hunka hunka!

187
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,519
You belong to him now.

188
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,339
Well...

189
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,759
You're cute.

190
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,579
You want me?

191
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,333
I'm all yours.

192
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,599
I don't want no beef.

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,199
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

194
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,439
Why, what's wrong?
You don't like me?

195
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

196
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,719
This is your lady.

197
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,371
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

198
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,054
No.

199
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,599
That's your lady, Joker.

200
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,799
That's right.

201
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,369
Yo, J.

202
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,620
And that was just the beginning.

203
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,211
Come on, Puddin'. Do it!

204
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,340
Oh.

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
We have got company.

206
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,170
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

207
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,119
She's crazier than him.

208
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,417
And more fearless.

209
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,893
Stupid Bat, you're ruining date night!

210
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,695
Puddin'.

211
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,091
Puddin', I can't swim!

212
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,578
But the Bat got her, too.
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.

213
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,493
And then there's the Aussie.

214
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,319
Digger Harkness.

215
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,653
Or as the tabloids call him,
Captain Boomerang.

216
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,599
We're gonna be rich.

217
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,959
Yeah, you and me, mate.

218
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,559
Go and get the car.

219
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,959
He robbed every bank
in Australia at least once.

220
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,577
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.

221
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,538
Doesn't work well with others.

222
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,292
No honor among thieves, eh?

223
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,332
But he tangled with a metahuman
and lived to tell about it.

224
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,217
And have you heard of
the pyrokinetic homeboy?

225
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,119
How'd you catch him?

226
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,178
We didn't. He surrendered.

227
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,399
Chato Santana.
On the streets they call him El Diablo.

228
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,414
This LA gangbanger thought
he was king of the world...

229
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,059
...until he lost his queen.

230
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,959
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

231
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,576
The security video is incredible.

232
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,879
Oh, Jesus. The hell is that?

233
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,018
His name is Waylon Jones.

234
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,293
Evolution took a step
backwards with this one.

235
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,319
Yo, K.C., it's supper.

236
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,492
Go ahead, open that up, B.

237
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,940
Got something
real nice for you today, boy.

238
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,536
Hey, boss,
it true he chewed a dude's hand off?

239
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,133
Look at that, right there.
Vulcanized rubber.

240
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,733
Give me that, Smitty.

241
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,719
Where you at?

242
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,573
Don't make me get you.

243
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,931
They call him Killer Croc.

244
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,199
Here you are! You hungry?

245
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,772
You want some food?
Go ahead, feed the man.

246
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,719
What are you in the mood for tonight?

247
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,879
I got a double cheeseburger,
onion rings, a little coleslaw.

248
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,689
Or a giant skinless goat.

249
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,693
He looked like a monster.

250
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,736
So they treated him like a monster.

251
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,848
Then he became a monster.

252
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,719
He was chased out of Gotham by the Bat.

253
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,479
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

254
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,379
He never found it.

255
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,479
I saved the best for last.

256
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,799
- The witch.
- A witch?

257
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,199
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

258
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,533
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

259
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,333
Archeologist Dr. June Moone,

260
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,571
wandered into the wrong cave.

261
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,139
June...

262
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,380
She opened something she shouldn't have...

263
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,130
...releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

264
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,568
The Enchantress.

265
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,576
She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.

266
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,369
And where is this witch?

267
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,079
In my pocket.

268
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,439
Now tell him
why she won't turn you into a frog.

269
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,439
Some say the witch
has a secret buried heart,

270
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,079
and whoever finds it
can control the witch.

271
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,879
So we searched the cave
where she turned up

272
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,018
and we found her heart.

273
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,719
That thing's her heart?

274
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,959
Mmm-hmm. She's vulnerable without it.

275
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,639
You want to put our national security
in the hands of

276
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,999
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

277
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,439
Don't forget about The Joker's girlfriend.

278
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,759
These are villains, Amanda.

279
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,171
What makes you think you can control them?

280
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,959
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interest

281
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,239
for the national security
of the United States

282
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,079
is what I do for a living.

283
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,079
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced,

284
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,695
Colonel Rick Flag.

285
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,599
Help me.

286
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,439
I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone,

287
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,738
and just as I hoped, it got personal.

288
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,719
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

289
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,439
I have the witch's heart.

290
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,771
And Dr. Moone has his.

291
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,218
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

292
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,759
In a world of flying men and monsters,

293
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,297
this is the only way
to protect our country.

294
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,199
What if Superman had decided to fly down,

295
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,159
rip off the roof of the White House

296
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,999
and grab the President
of the United States

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,660
right out of the Oval Office?

298
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,933
Who would've stopped him?

299
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,799
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea,

300
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,199
anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.

301
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,376
But what happens if the next Superman
becomes a terrorist?

302
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,279
Amanda Waller has a plan. Amanda?

303
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,759
I wanna build a team
of some very bad people

304
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,559
who I think can do some good.

305
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,199
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

306
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,839
Not on my watch.

307
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,439
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

308
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,879
General, we run them
covertly, non-attributed.

309
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,519
Strictly need to know.

310
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,170
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.

311
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,599
The next war will be fought
with these metahumans.

312
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,759
Ours, or theirs.

313
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,319
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

314
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,890
You know we can't control these people.

315
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,173
June, be strong.

316
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,529
Dr. Moone.

317
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,138
Enchantress.

318
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,279
Meet the Enchantress.

319
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,599
Everything we know about her
is in your briefing packs.

320
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,519
She's walked this earth
for a very long time

321
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

322
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,639
This meeting is now a magic show?

323
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,132
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

324
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,293
Go get it, girl.

325
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,933
How about a little something
from the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

326
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,093
We've been chasing these plans for years.

327
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,159
Uh, please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

328
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,616
Thank you. We'd like Dr. Moone back.

329
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,333
Enchantress.

330
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,639
Please. Please.

331
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
I'm sorry, I can't do that again.

332
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,098
Flag, get her out of here.

333
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,479
I move to, uh, authorize Amanda Waller
to establish Task Force X

334
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,538
under the ARGUS program.

335
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,079
All right.

336
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,377
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

337
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,333
I know you do bad things.

338
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,013
Don't worry, I still love you.

339
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,559
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

340
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,039
How you doing, man?

341
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,919
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.

342
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,759
Welcome, ma'am. How are you?

343
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,216
I'm here to assist you in any way.

344
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,219
Where are they?

345
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,651
Are you the Devil?

346
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,419
Maybe.

347
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,291
Ain't you scared?

348
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,569
Why'd they put you down here?

349
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,018
I asked.

350
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,619
Open that gate.

351
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,159
Yo, ese.

352
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,252
Hola, amigo.

353
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,615
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

354
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,399
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?

355
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,900
Then come down here.

356
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,279
That ain't me.

357
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,439
That wasn't you?

358
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,839
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.
That guy's gone.

359
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,159
He's dead.

360
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,279
- And yet, here you are.
- Ma'am.

361
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,179
Let me try to talk to him.

362
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,839
You wanna die in here, buddy?

363
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,399
You got a real shot
at walking the block again.

364
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,653
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

365
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,999
A woman.

366
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,879
Look, man, you ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

367
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,519
Ask what?

368
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,012
I'm a man, okay? I ain't no weapon.

369
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,694
I'mma die in peace
before I raise my fists again.

370
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,971
I've caused enough harm.

371
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,559
All right, unlock him.

372
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,479
- What?
- You heard me.

373
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,879
You know what this man can do?

374
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,531
I'm here to find out. Lose the restraints.

375
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,894
Okay.

376
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,859
What is this? Uh, cheerleading tryouts?

377
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,039
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

378
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,213
They say you never missed a shot.
Prove it.

379
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,060
Mmm-hmm.

380
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,251
Now you got one in the chamber.
What you gonna do with it?

381
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,014
Shit!

382
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,239
Give me the word, boss. I'll drop him.

383
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,639
Everybody calm down.

384
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,239
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

385
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,599
Tell them, "Put it down."

386
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,799
Stand down.

387
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,759
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

388
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,919
What's for dinner?

389
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,479
Ames, if this man shoots me,

390
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,732
I want you to kill him

391
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,337
and I want you to go clear
my browser history.

392
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,319
See, uh,
the firing pin is filed down, right?

393
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,719
Mag full of dummy rounds.
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

394
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,519
You're absolutely right.

395
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,399
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

396
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,079
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

397
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,599
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

398
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,519
I've known you, like, nine months.

399
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,540
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.

400
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,858
What?

401
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,660
Oops.

402
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,856
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

403
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,439
All right. Now you know
what you're buying.

404
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,839
Let me tell you the price.
First, I want out of here.

405
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,119
Second, I want full custody
of my daughter.

406
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,199
All right? And her mom can have, like,
supervised visits.

407
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,599
But her stank-ass boyfriend can't come.
Darnell can't come.

408
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,359
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

409
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,359
Third, y'all gonna pay
for my daughter's whole education.

410
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,199
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

411
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,879
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

412
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,839
- So Ivy League.
- Ivy League, yeah.

413
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,439
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

414
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,559
And, uh, if she can't cut it
and her grades start slipping,

415
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,159
I need you to white-people that thing.

416
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,359
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know how y'all do.

417
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,879
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, right? Okay.

418
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,359
Now that's my price.

419
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,679
But I'm concerned 'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

420
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,439
You're in no position to make any demands.

421
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,534
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

422
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,292
No, errand boy. I'm talking to your boss.

423
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,697
That's my price, sweetie.
You know what it is.

424
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,759
You notice these are criminals, hmm?

425
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,239
They're psychotic, antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

426
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,279
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you

427
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,199
a team of pipe hitters who'll
do anything you can dream up.

428
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,559
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

429
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,239
In World War Two,
the US Navy made a deal with the mafia

430
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,039
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

431
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,639
This ain't World War Two.

432
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,459
It's World War Three.

433
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,199
What are you really up to?

434
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,039
It's a "need to know", and all you need
to know is you work for me.

435
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,850
That can change with a phone call.
I have friends, too, you know.

436
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,812
There you go. Call.

437
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,159
But without you minding her,

438
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,494
your lady friend stays here strapped
to a board in a drug-induced coma.

439
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,612
They warned me about you.

440
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,575
My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.

441
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,653
Nobody does.

442
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,599
Where is she?

443
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,799
It's complex. This is not just her.

444
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,799
Everybody's disappearing.

445
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,959
There's this new law,

446
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,119
where if you're a bad enough bad guy,
they stamp "terrorist" on your jacket.

447
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,479
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.
A black site.

448
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,652
That's where she is.

449
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,738
So what are we doing?

450
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,458
Bring the car around.

451
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,290
We're going for a drive.

452
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,933
Lester, Lester!
Hit me one more time!

453
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,519
Come on, man!

454
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,580
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10 K.

455
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,039
- Hey!
- Ow!

456
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,849
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

457
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,879
Good job, man. He's killing it.

458
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,279
Come on, man. Why am I here?

459
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,399
All right, yeah, I'm down.
I get it, all right?

460
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,719
I've had a run of bad decks.
Not my fault. All right?

461
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,399
Dude, this is real.

462
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,892
I had to stop these guys from burning
down your house with your kids in it.

463
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,319
But you're lucky.

464
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,776
Maybe. Why do you think so?

465
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,492
Yo, slick. What's up?

466
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,399
Griggs. You are?

467
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,380
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

468
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,959
Can I go, man?
What the hell is going on, man?

469
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,479
This is crazy.

470
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,199
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.

471
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,816
Blah-blah, blah, blah.

472
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,759
All of that chitchat's gonna get ya hurt.

473
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,409
Oh! My God!

474
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,420
Mmm.

475
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,279
I could tell you meant that.

476
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,658
Yeah.

477
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,930
You're gonna be my friend.

478
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,930
Enchantress.

479
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,815
- Log time of death. 1620.
- June?

480
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,239
Let's get her down to the morgue.

481
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,492
June? June?

482
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,815
June.

483
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,209
June.

484
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,573
What did you do?

485
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,420
Shh.

486
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,569
Okay.

487
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,816
Plus, it could be the routing number.

488
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,850
Wanna go for drinks?

489
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,412
Enchantress.

490
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,452
God damn it!

491
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,815
June! June!

492
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,938
June, I'm sorry.

493
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,015
Shh.

494
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,418
She went somewhere.

495
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,959
If you have to choose between her or me,
stop her.

496
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,496
Promise me you'll stop her.

497
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,979
Even if it kills me.

498
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,173
Sir. Sir. You okay?

499
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,175
Can you breathe? Did you take anything?

500
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,854
This is 21.
Send medical to my location.

501
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,719
I'm a physician.

502
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,679
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.

503
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,410
No pulse. Starting compressions.

504
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,879
Sir.

505
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,719
Midway City is under attack.
It's a non-human entity.

506
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,199
I think you know what to do, sir.

507
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,239
Activate Task Force X

508
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,959
and get Amanda Waller
and her whole circus on scene ASAP.

509
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,495
Sir.

510
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,411
We're going live
with Task Force X. Pull 'em.

511
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,759
Prisoner,
get down on your knees, now!

512
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,199
Down on your knees!
Hands in the air! Turn around.

513
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,399
Hands up high!

514
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,039
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

515
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,417
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

516
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,576
Do not fire
that goddamn weapon!

517
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,300
Damn it!

518
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,519
Open the gate!

519
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,279
Everybody, line up for extraction.

520
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,418
Let's go! Let's move, move.

521
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,290
Yeah. Open the door! Let's go!

522
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,719
Hit him!

523
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,700
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

524
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,335
Where you at?

525
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,940
Whoa!

526
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,249
Is that the new guy?

527
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,839
What is that? What is that? Who are you?

528
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,599
- Stand by. Arming device.
- Who are you?

529
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,079
- I don't know who you are.
- Device armed.

530
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,333
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

531
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,532
Injection successful.

532
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,654
Location verified.

533
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,919
- Anybody who touches me is dead.
- Anybody who...

534
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,799
- Lady. Hey.
- Injection successful.

535
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,359
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

536
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,559
Next!

537
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,415
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

538
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,129
Come on.

539
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,900
Shut up, and get it done.

540
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,759
Whee!

541
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,559
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

542
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,799
It's from Mr. J.

543
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,319
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

544
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,439
You're so screwed.

545
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,799
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

546
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,655
Get off me! Get off me!
Harley, what do you mean by that?

547
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,092
Harley!

548
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,799
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss.

549
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,679
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

550
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,092
Hey, cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

551
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,818
Thank you. You're a good man.

552
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,853
Open up!

553
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,531
Just please, do whatever they say.

554
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,660
Do whatever they say. Just do it.

555
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,420
Hmm.

556
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,409
This looks neat.

557
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,256
Light it up!
Light it up! Light it up!

558
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,039
He's right above us.

559
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,999
This is a mistake. Rick, I can't do this.

560
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,559
- I can't...
- Listen, listen.

561
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,539
There's no other way.

562
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,778
Just get it done.

563
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,413
Just get it done.

564
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,934
Enchantress.

565
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,660
Flag, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

566
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,119
Amanda, she bolted.

567
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,639
Say it again?

568
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,653
She bolted!

569
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,415
Shit!

570
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,975
Go!

571
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,919
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

572
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,331
I thought this was contained!

573
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,498
This is the worst day of my life!

574
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,296
All evacuees
must report to a FEMA representative.

575
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,011
What's going on in that city?

576
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,218
Those assholes here yet?

577
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,780
Yeah, they're here.

578
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,009
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

579
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,976
What the hell, Flag?

580
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,689
Unlock 'em.

581
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,180
Mmm!

582
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,719
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

583
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,699
How do you do?

584
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,849
Huh?

585
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,537
What was that?
I should kill everyone and escape?

586
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,933
Sorry. It's the voices.

587
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,576
I'm kidding! Jeez!

588
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,039
That's not what they really said.

589
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,759
What do we got here?

590
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,615
Twelve pounds of shit in a 10-pound sack.

591
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,730
Welcome to the party,
Captain Boomerang.

592
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,639
Hey, what's going on, man?

593
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,799
Calm down.

594
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,079
Hey, one minute
I'm playing Mahjong with me nanna,

595
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,519
then this red streak hits me
outta nowhere.

596
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,239
Shut up! You were caught
robbing a diamond exchange.

597
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,934
I was not!

598
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,439
Here comes Slipknot,
the man who can climb anything. Wonderful.

599
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,399
Have a good time, scumbag.

600
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,299
Ooh.

601
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,215
Straighten up.

602
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,519
She had a mouth.

603
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,136
Listen up!

604
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,298
In your necks,

605
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,159
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

606
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,319
It's the size of a rice grain,
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

607
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,254
You disobey me, you die.

608
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,159
You try to escape, you die.

609
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,131
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?

610
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,719
You die.

611
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,759
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

612
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,415
Lady, shut up!

613
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,694
This is the deal.

614
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,839
You're going somewhere very bad,
to do something that'll get you killed.

615
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,819
But until that happens,

616
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,959
you're my problem.

617
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,460
Mmm.

618
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,079
So was that like a, uh, pep talk?

619
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,519
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

620
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,214
There's your shit.

621
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,039
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

622
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,319
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

623
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,079
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

624
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,359
He's like the gold standard, okay?

625
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,499
Triangle, bitch. Study.

626
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,380
What?

627
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,140
Won't fit anymore?

628
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,239
Too much junk in the trunk?

629
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,574
Nah. Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.

630
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,740
And?

631
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,412
I like putting it on.

632
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,079
Goody.

633
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,439
Somethin' tells me
a whole lotta people are about to die!

634
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,039
Yeah. It's us.

635
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,279
We're being led to our deaths.

636
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,159
Speak for yourself, mate.

637
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,740
Hey, what's that crap on your face?
Does it wash off?

638
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,959
Hey, if you like a girl, can you light
her cigarette with your pinkie?

639
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,759
Because that would be real classy!

640
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,439
Hey, y'all might
wanna leave old boy alone.

641
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,879
He could torch this whole joint.
Ain't that right, ese?

642
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,119
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.
I'm cool, homie.

643
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,451
Behold the voice of God.

644
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,959
For those of you
who don't know me officially,

645
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,132
my name is Amanda Waller.

646
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,119
There's an active terrorist event
in Midway City.

647
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,932
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1, and get them to safety.

648
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,999
I'm sorry. Uh...

649
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,759
For those of us who don't
speak good guy, what is HVT-1?

650
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,879
The only person
that matters in the city,

651
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,972
the one person you can't kill.

652
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,519
Complete the mission,
you get time off your prison sentence.

653
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,439
Fail the mission, you die.

654
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,489
Anything happens to Colonel Flag,
I'll kill every single one of you.

655
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,178
Remember, I'm watching.

656
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,299
I see everything.

657
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,652
There's your pep talk.

658
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,171
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

659
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,839
So that's it?

660
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,879
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

661
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,848
I'll notify your next of kin.

662
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,695
Alpha, Bravo team. Mount up!

663
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,940
You're late.

664
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,319
This is Katana. She's got my back.

665
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,399
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke,

666
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,079
just like mowing the lawn.

667
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,159
I would advise not getting killed by her.

668
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,891
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

669
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,759
Harley Quinn. Nice to meet ya.

670
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,919
Love your perfume.

671
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,809
What is that? The stench of death?

672
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,620
Whoa! Easy, cowgirl.
Ain't that kind of a mission. Have a seat.

673
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,579
She seems nice.

674
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,340
Shh.

675
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,820
Hey.

676
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,780
Is he supposed to be green like that?

677
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,119
Oh!

678
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,973
Party foul!

679
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,213
Not cool.

680
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,937
Ooh. Look at the pretty lights!

681
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,177
Are you guys seeing this?

682
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,540
What happened?

683
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,799
Terror attack.

684
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,199
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

685
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,319
You know, usual shit.

686
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,820
Right.

687
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,651
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

688
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,359
I don't know if they told you,

689
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,639
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

690
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,653
Anything for a dollar, right?

691
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,799
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

692
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,839
I'm a soldier!

693
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,839
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

694
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,652
When the shooting starts,
and it will, you'll cut and run.

695
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,359
Six-one is going down.

696
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,737
Six-one is going down hard.

697
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,738
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

698
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,439
Whoo! What a ride!

699
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,976
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

700
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,239
- Mind games.
- What's that?

701
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,776
All this bomb in the neck crap.

702
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,729
That ain't real, mate.

703
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,199
See, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?

704
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,959
But you look around, we're free, brah.

705
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,119
How do you know this?

706
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,479
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

707
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,599
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

708
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,091
Question is, are you coming?

709
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,176
Yeah. Smart!

710
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,940
Hold your fire.

711
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,692
Sorry. It's what I do.

712
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,020
Damn it.

713
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,919
Now that's a killer app!

714
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,639
Okay. You wanna keep playing

715
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,279
the Hollywood Squares version
of "I'll Blow Your Freaking Head Off"?

716
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,780
Are you next?

717
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,934
You tripping, homie.

718
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,418
You next, Deadshot?

719
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,199
You just threatened me?

720
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,799
Oh, yeah.

721
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,813
He just threatened me.

722
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,639
Move.

723
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,698
You got a boyfriend?

724
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,679
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

725
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,839
Well, you better make it quick

726
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,060
'cause he's gonna kill
all of us one by one.

727
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,039
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady,
five or seven of these SEALs.

728
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,279
After that, I'm gonna need
some help. You down?

729
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,959
Always. What about the shit in our necks?

730
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,133
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

731
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,410
You're my friend, too.

732
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,017
Stay evil, doll face. Spread the word.

733
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,999
So...

734
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,319
I'm thinking if we move together,

735
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,399
we can kill all these guys
and go our separate ways.

736
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,174
- Yeah?
- Sounds good.

737
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,659
Spread the word.

738
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,299
Psst. Oi. Oi.

739
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,519
We need your help, man.

740
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,239
When the time's right,

741
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,173
you hit Flag with a fireball.

742
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,051
He'll be too busy burning to death
to have a go at us with his phone of doom.

743
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,620
Then what?

744
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,819
Then we get out of here.

745
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,159
And do what?

746
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,319
What are you,
bloody Socrates, with all the questions?

747
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,935
Freedom, man.

748
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,378
Freedom! You remember that, don't you?

749
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,959
We're criminals. You know that, right?

750
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,679
Yeah. It's great.

751
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,408
Come on, do the bastard.

752
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,079
Hey, be careful.

753
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,279
He eats people.

754
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,079
Sorry, Mother Superior, what?

755
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,919
He eats people for reals, homie.

756
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,399
He's a cannibal.

757
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,128
Oh.

758
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,575
No.

759
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,799
What did you say to him?

760
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,256
Nothing. Just having a laugh.

761
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,254
No worries.

762
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,660
I'm standing by for follow on tac team.

763
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,639
C2, what is the operational load
of the PLS?

764
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,539
Boss, we got people up here.

765
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,332
I'm on my way.

766
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,279
Shit.

767
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,439
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.

768
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,359
Flag, get out of there.

769
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,839
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

770
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,719
Copy that.

771
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,199
We're diverting.

772
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,879
Bump out second squad two blocks east.

773
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,679
We'll pass through you, continue north.

774
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,239
Take Bravo two blocks east.

775
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,199
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

776
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,700
Copy that.

777
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,999
Hey. I like these odds, mate.
You just say the word.

778
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,500
Yeah.

779
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,359
Come on.

780
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,559
Yeah, uh...

781
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,379
Hold that thought.

782
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,599
Rick, why do they look like that?

783
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,772
Just stay cool.

784
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,655
The hell are they?

785
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,571
You cut and run, I'll blow your head off.

786
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,620
Hit them!

787
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,900
Huh.

788
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,580
Hey.

789
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,620
Ha!

790
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,500
Get off me!

791
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,895
Get off me! Son of a...

792
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,615
Flag!

793
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,999
- Good riddance.
- Harley!

794
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,853
He dies, we die.

795
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,573
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

796
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,769
Backblast, clear!

797
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,215
Pinky.

798
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,416
That's how I cut and run.

799
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,359
Hey.

800
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,599
Hey, come on.

801
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,250
What? I saw it move.

802
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,654
See? It flinched. I think.

803
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,979
Hey, you were some help, princess.

804
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,414
It's better this way.

805
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,719
Trust me.

806
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,599
Oh, yeah, you're the fire bloke, eh?

807
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,295
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah. Hey.

808
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,439
Well, looky here.

809
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,239
Whoo! It's fire.

810
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,740
Whoo!

811
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,736
The brief said terrorists.

812
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,999
You wanna start explaining this?

813
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,180
If I told you, would you believe me?

814
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,879
- What are they?
- I don't know.

815
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,859
That's bullshit.

816
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,849
Thing has on a $3,000 watch.

817
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,619
Is that a person?

818
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,260
It was.

819
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,499
Now it's not.

820
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,855
Hey, don't!

821
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,359
What?

822
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,134
We got a job to do.

823
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,340
We're moving.

824
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,331
Get your boys moving.

825
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,173
Let's go.

826
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,559
Waller,
we're moving on the objective.

827
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,159
We lost contact with Bravo.
You got a visual?

828
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,359
Stand by.

829
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,839
- Anything on the other squad?
- No, ma'am.

830
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,359
Go-7, I need your sensors
on those coordinates.

831
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,519
Flag, it's a negative.

832
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,978
They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.

833
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,599
Seriously?

834
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,119
The hell is wrong with you people?

835
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,578
We're bad guys. It's what we do.

836
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,559
Hey, Deadshot. I've been thinking.

837
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,097
If we don't come together,
no one's walking out of here alive.

838
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,479
Hmm.

839
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,119
And?

840
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,736
These people respect you.
You got influence.

841
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,279
All right. What's your play right now?

842
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,293
You're a man of your word, right?

843
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,599
I want my mission.

844
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,931
You want your life and your kid back.

845
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,730
You help me keep this Mardi Gras parade
in line and I'll hook you up.

846
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,479
Waller is the puppet master.

847
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,159
You ain't got shit to hook me up with.

848
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,119
I got plenty of my own strings to pull.

849
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,879
You just get them
to the top of that target building

850
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,291
and get my rescuee
on that extraction helo.

851
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,959
And you're gonna make sure I get paid?

852
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,609
And you get paid.

853
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,460
You get paid,
and you get your fresh start.

854
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,700
Take a knee.

855
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,679
Our body's at the top of that building.

856
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,159
We get up there,

857
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,999
pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.

858
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,959
Helos extract us off the roof.

859
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,018
- It's Miller time.
- Check.

860
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,079
Flag, who's up there?

861
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,319
That's none of your concern.

862
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,239
- Do you know who's up there?
- No.

863
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,679
Is it the President?

864
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,340
It's not the President.

865
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,654
Argh!

866
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,519
Oh, you!

867
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,679
You're not leaving me.
You're not leaving me!

868
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,375
You're a pain in the ass.

869
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,279
I have done everything you said.

870
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,679
Every test, every trial, every initiation.

871
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,639
I have proved I love you. Just accept it.

872
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,519
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

873
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,899
I am not someone who is loved.

874
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,999
I'm an idea.

875
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,399
A state of mind.

876
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,159
I execute my will according to my plan.

877
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,618
And you, Doctor...

878
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,119
Are not part of my plan.

879
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,919
Just let me in. I promise...
Let me in! I promise I won't hurt you.

880
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,399
A promise-promise?

881
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,333
Hey, dickface!

882
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,255
Mind screaming at your bitch
somewhere else?

883
01:06:41,717 --> 01:06:44,611
I was gonna say,
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."

884
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,253
Don't hurt me.

885
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,935
I'll be your friend.

886
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,239
Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

887
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,919
My heart scares you, and a gun doesn't?

888
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,489
DO IT!

889
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,455
If you weren't so crazy,
I'd think you were insane.

890
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,330
Go away.

891
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,258
Harley, you coming?

892
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,972
Why do you eat people?

893
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,295
Gives me their power.

894
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,255
Would you like to eat me?

895
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,159
Hell, no.

896
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,799
Aw, why not?

897
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,291
I don't want your crazy.

898
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,839
Says the guy who lives in a sewer.

899
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,331
At least I know it's a sewer.

900
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,679
Oh, I get it.

901
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,079
'Cause like, this is a sewer, too,

902
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,479
only with
nice shops and restaurants, right?

903
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,494
- Mmm.
- You hate mankind much?

904
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,169
Let me guess.

905
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,855
Mommy didn't take you to Chuck E. Cheese
on your sixth birthday.

906
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,740
I can recommend a good therapist.

907
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,199
Why?

908
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,719
Because I'm bored.

909
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,919
I need a victim,
a mind to pry apart and spit in.

910
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,695
Leave it, mate.
She's a rabbit hole. Don't fall in.

911
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,697
And here's one now.

912
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,999
Japanese, female.

913
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,439
Mid-20s, 5'5", good health, athletic.

914
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,373
And...

915
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,459
An only child.

916
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,252
With deep-seated father issues.

917
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,374
Daddy wanted a son,
so she has to hide behind a mask.

918
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,097
I am not

919
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,694
hiding.

920
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,693
Now, that was gangster.

921
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,199
Harley.

922
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,079
Why don't you
stop acting like a drunken stripper?

923
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,079
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on, then?

924
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,279
'Cause...

925
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,975
I smell a rat.

926
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,799
If they don't blow our heads off,

927
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,211
we'll have to
fight our way out of this city.

928
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,359
I need you to
play nice with the other children.

929
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,049
And quietly return to my cage.

930
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,059
Sure, okay.

931
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,519
Hey, that's okay, sellout.
I get it. I get it.

932
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:43,194
I know how the world works, okay?

933
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:45,711
And when it comes to the heart,

934
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,978
everyone for themselves, right?

935
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,855
Waller?

936
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,573
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.

937
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,799
What do you say we get this over with?

938
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,655
What the hell? Deadshot. Fall back.

939
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,333
You mind if we tag along?

940
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,936
Whoo! Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

941
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,839
Be a walk in the park.

942
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,639
Easy peasy.

943
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,812
Don't make me shoot you.

944
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,853
God damn it. Harley!

945
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,649
Go, go, go, go!

946
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,855
Hey, guys!

947
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,739
Come on. Let's go.

948
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,570
Ma'am. I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.

949
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,199
- Flag, they're all around you.
- Hold.

950
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,691
Use extreme caution.

951
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,939
I don't like this, Flag.

952
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,298
I don't like it either.

953
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,439
Pussy.

954
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,719
I will knock your ass out.

955
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,573
I do not care that you're a girl.

956
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,619
They're after Flag again.

957
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,258
Son of a bitch. Get off me.

958
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,492
Circle up. Circle around him.

959
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,250
- Let me fight!
- You die, we die.

960
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,331
Clear! Everyone move out!

961
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,199
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

962
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,119
You know what? You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

963
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,359
Don't touch me, man!

964
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,679
Don't touch you? What you gonna do?

965
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,679
- Don't touch me!
- I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

966
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,679
- Do something. Do something!
- Don't touch me!

967
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,159
- You wanna see something?
- Oh, yeah, I wanna see...

968
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,860
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something.

969
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,651
I was just trying to get you there.

970
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,379
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

971
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,379
I knew you'd come through.

972
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,413
That shit crazy.

973
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,734
Clear.

974
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,096
I gotta work on my cardio.

975
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,772
Question.

976
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,898
Would you die for me?

977
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,839
Yes.

978
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,898
That's too easy.

979
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,379
Would you...

980
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,896
Would you live for me?

981
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,599
Mmm?

982
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,294
Yes.

983
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,279
Careful.

984
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,456
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

985
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,657
Desire becomes surrender.
Surrender becomes power.

986
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,888
Do you want this?

987
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,919
I do.

988
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,439
Say it.

989
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,319
Say it. Say it.

990
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,999
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

991
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,615
Please.

992
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,338
Aw! God, you're so...

993
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,975
Good.

994
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,159
Whoa!

995
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,252
Relax. Just me.

996
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,012
You ever been in love?

997
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,759
Nah. Never.

998
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,199
Bullshit.

999
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,199
You don't kill as many people
as I've killed

1000
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:50,329
and still sleep like a kitten
if you feel shit like love.

1001
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,857
Another textbook sociopath.

1002
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,369
Clear.

1003
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,439
All right, secure the roof.

1004
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,199
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

1005
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,735
Going to the roof.

1006
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,172
Oh. Wait here.

1007
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,519
Please.

1008
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,580
I don't wanna give this dude
a heart attack. Okay?

1009
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,119
Aw, he's embarrassed of us!

1010
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,519
Hey, Flag.

1011
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,329
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

1012
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,690
You ready? Let's go.

1013
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,279
You wouldn't have made it without them.

1014
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,479
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

1015
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,999
Admit it, Rick. I was right.

1016
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,799
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.
Why'd you stay?

1017
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,719
I was studying your girlfriend.

1018
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,559
She takes an average person,
a yoga mom, an elderly retiree,

1019
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,980
and she turns them into a soldier
who can take a headshot and still fight.

1020
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,298
It's an instant army.

1021
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,528
How'd she do it, Flag?

1022
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,730
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

1023
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,332
I'll accept the consequences.

1024
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,599
I am your consequence.

1025
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,660
You might need to be careful.

1026
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,919
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

1027
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,599
I can take care of myself.

1028
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,959
Shut it down, wipe the drives.

1029
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,940
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

1030
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,359
Uh, hey, man. I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped

1031
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,039
in your temple of soldierly
self-righteousness,

1032
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,639
but a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

1033
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,679
Oh, says the guy
who shoots people for money.

1034
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,039
My cards is on the table, man.

1035
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,939
It got done, didn't it?

1036
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:47,092
Damn. That is just a mean lady.

1037
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,732
Yeah. You get used to it.

1038
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,531
And I'm the bad guy?

1039
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,019
That's gangsta.

1040
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,879
What?

1041
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,839
They weren't cleared for any of this.
Any of it.

1042
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,332
Hey, I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

1043
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,054
No way.

1044
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,399
Let's go home.

1045
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,458
Yeah, let's go home.

1046
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,959
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home? Hmm?

1047
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,119
Or you wanna go back to prison?

1048
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,759
I'm not going back to prison.

1049
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,013
What I'm saying is we kill the pair of 'em
now before they kill us.

1050
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,257
I got this.

1051
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,051
You all made it this far.

1052
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,058
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.

1053
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,298
I like her.

1054
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,215
Savior One-Zero,
this is Ground Element.

1055
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,613
Savior One-Zero, how copy?

1056
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,095
Savior One-Zero, the LZ's clear.

1057
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,180
Boss, they're not talking to me.

1058
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,415
Our bird's been jacked.

1059
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,220
Light it up!

1060
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,039
What? I got a hickey or something?

1061
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,531
Professor,
could you pick up the pace?

1062
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,895
Harley!

1063
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,534
Hello, baby.

1064
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,980
Kill her!

1065
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,731
Her nanite's disarmed!

1066
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,414
Come on, baby.

1067
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,015
Deadshot,

1068
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,559
shoot that woman right now!

1069
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,599
She ain't do shit to me.

1070
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,839
You're a hitman, right?

1071
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,239
I got a contract.

1072
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:09,619
Kill Harley Quinn.
Do it for your freedom and your kid.

1073
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,412
Now she dead.

1074
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,169
I missed.

1075
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,100
Good one, mate.

1076
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,079
It's Waller.

1077
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,679
Savior One-Zero's been hijacked.
Shoot it down.

1078
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,136
Roger that, ma'am. Going hot.

1079
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,415
Puddin'!

1080
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,159
You got all dressed up for me?

1081
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,799
Oh, you know I'd do anything for you.

1082
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,479
By the way,
I've got some grape soda on ice,

1083
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,959
and a bear skin rug waiting.

1084
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,439
Yeah?

1085
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,039
Boss, we got a problem!

1086
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,689
Huh?

1087
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,053
- This bird is baked.
- No.

1088
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,839
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

1089
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,568
Let's do it.

1090
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,319
Target destroyed, ma'am.

1091
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,856
Thank you. Now get me off this roof.

1092
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,418
Yes, ma'am. We are inbound.

1093
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,896
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

1094
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,454
You couldn't save her.

1095
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,419
Roger. I see ya.

1096
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,780
Watch your step, ma'am.

1097
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,018
Stand by. I'll send another helo!

1098
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,399
Waller's down.

1099
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,900
It's over.

1100
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,015
Ops just confirmed. She's down. 1 k west.

1101
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,258
Let's go get her.

1102
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,839
The mission's not over.

1103
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,359
Nah. It is for me. We had a deal.

1104
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,851
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1105
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,698
Hey, guys. I'm back!

1106
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,409
I missed you all so much.

1107
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,973
We're glad you could make it.

1108
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,731
Hey, craziness.

1109
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:15,449
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1110
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,519
Now tell me how to destroy your armies.

1111
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,897
Do your worst, bitch!

1112
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,460
So let me guess.

1113
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,639
We're going to
the swirling ring of trash in the sky.

1114
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,812
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?

1115
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,039
When does this end, Flag?

1116
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,053
Load up. We're in for a fight.

1117
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,456
You tell everybody everything.

1118
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,369
Or me and you gonna go right now.

1119
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,359
Three days ago,

1120
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,658
a non-human entity appeared
in the subway station.

1121
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,719
Waller, we're almost there.

1122
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,359
So Waller sent me and a woman
with incredible abilities.

1123
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,691
Enchantress.

1124
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,213
A witch.

1125
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,491
See, nobody could get near this thing,
but the witch could.

1126
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,519
Bomb's ready.

1127
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,239
Set for two seconds.

1128
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,260
You just press the button and drop it.

1129
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,799
Needless to say,
the whole thing was a bad idea.

1130
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,119
She bolted!

1131
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,099
Shit!

1132
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,733
And that's how she escaped from Waller.

1133
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,499
So now you know.

1134
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,811
You can just kill me right now,

1135
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,773
but I'm going to have a drink.

1136
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,779
Hey, Deadshot, I need your help.

1137
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,372
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1138
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,532
What ya having, K.C.?

1139
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,532
Bloody Mary, right?

1140
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,490
Drink dulls the mind.

1141
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:28,319
K.C., it's the end of the world.

1142
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,378
Have a drink with us.

1143
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,279
Beer.

1144
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,930
There he is. Give the man a beer.

1145
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,659
How about you, hot stuff?

1146
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,239
Water.

1147
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,298
That's a good idea, honey.

1148
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,015
Ninja?

1149
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,620
You want some sake?

1150
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,359
Whiskey.

1151
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,929
Whiskey.

1152
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,809
Okay.

1153
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,340
What am I, 12?

1154
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:08,491
Here's to honor among thieves.

1155
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,579
I'm not a thief.

1156
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,132
Oh. She's not a thief.

1157
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:24,172
I actually prefer to think of myself
as an asset relocation specialist.

1158
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,959
Mmm.

1159
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,519
Well, we almost pulled it off

1160
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,739
despite what everybody thought.

1161
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,810
We weren't picked to succeed.
You know that, right?

1162
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,999
We were all chosen to fail.

1163
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,599
Yeah, I know that.

1164
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,239
Worst part of it is, they're going to
blame us for the whole thing.

1165
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,095
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.

1166
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,959
We're the patsies.

1167
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,688
The cover-up.

1168
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:52,215
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

1169
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,959
So you gonna tell us now
what your "big deal" with Flag was?

1170
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,479
Same thing Waller offered me, to kill you.

1171
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,777
The chance to be a father.

1172
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,650
Chance at a life outside the shadows.

1173
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,173
I trusted Flag.

1174
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,559
Flag had you
chasing a carrot on a stick, homie.

1175
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,380
You don't... You don't know that?

1176
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,919
I love this guy.

1177
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,559
You played yourself, dawg.

1178
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,698
Bitch, I'm having a drink.

1179
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,599
I'm breathing fresh air.

1180
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,959
And, uh,

1181
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,610
for two sweet seconds...

1182
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,378
I had hope.

1183
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,612
You had hope, huh?

1184
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,359
Hope don't stop
the wheel from turning, my brother.

1185
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,239
Hmm. You preaching?

1186
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,571
It's coming back around for you.

1187
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,773
How many people you killed, man?

1188
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,319
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1189
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,239
You ain't ever whacked down no women.

1190
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,219
No kids.

1191
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,332
I don't kill women or children.

1192
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,860
I do.

1193
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,599
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

1194
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,439
I kept it hidden
for most of my life, but...

1195
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,239
The older I got, the stronger it got.

1196
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,492
So I started using it.

1197
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,452
For business, you know.

1198
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,479
The more power on the street I got,
the more fire power I got.

1199
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,879
Like, that shit went hand in hand.

1200
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,940
You know? One was feeding the other.

1201
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,090
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1202
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,773
Except my old lady.

1203
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,399
You know, she used to, uh, pray for me.

1204
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,900
You're welcome.

1205
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,528
Even when I didn't want it.

1206
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:51,136
God didn't give me this.

1207
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,329
Why should he take it away?

1208
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,329
Hey.

1209
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,319
This is our home.

1210
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,879
You put that back where you found it.

1211
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,519
I'm taking my kids to Mom's.

1212
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,679
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

1213
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:08,411
See, when I get mad, I lose control.
You know, I just...

1214
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,700
I don't know what I do...

1215
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,338
...till it's done.

1216
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,293
And the kids?

1217
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,053
He killed them.

1218
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,453
Didn't you?

1219
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,252
Own that shit.

1220
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,879
Own it!

1221
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,559
What'd you think was gonna happen? Huh?

1222
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,399
Hey, Harley. Come on.

1223
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,279
What, you were just...

1224
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,039
Thinking you can have a happy family

1225
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,959
and coach little leagues,
and make car payments?

1226
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,879
Normal's a setting on the dryer.

1227
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,479
People like us, we don't get normal!

1228
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,839
Why is it always a knife fight

1229
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,059
every single time you open your mouth?

1230
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,095
You know, outside you're amazing.

1231
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:27,039
But inside, you're ugly.

1232
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,959
We all are.

1233
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,770
We all are! Except for him.

1234
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,159
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1235
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,730
Not me, shorty.

1236
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,611
I'm beautiful.

1237
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:47,375
Yeah, you are.

1238
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,853
We don't want you here.

1239
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:10,294
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1240
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,848
Yeah.

1241
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,973
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

1242
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:23,199
Apparently, that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1243
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,239
'Cause, uh, the witch is scared of him.

1244
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,651
The only woman I ever cared about

1245
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:31,439
is trapped inside that monster.

1246
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,159
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.

1247
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,839
Everything is over.

1248
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,058
Everything.

1249
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,260
You're free to go.

1250
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,492
Your daughter writes you every day.

1251
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,537
Every single day.

1252
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,137
You had these the whole time?

1253
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:27,136
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?

1254
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,699
I'm gonna get you there.

1255
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,199
And you're gonna end this.

1256
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,009
I'm gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1257
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:42,616
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1258
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,410
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

1259
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:51,054
And my daughter is gonna know
that her daddy is not a piece of shit.

1260
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:02,253
I'll come.

1261
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,159
What?

1262
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,719
You got something better to do?

1263
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,733
Come on!

1264
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,929
Pussies.

1265
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,559
We think that thing's a weapon.

1266
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,129
Here. Lower.

1267
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,737
We gotta take out the big one.

1268
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,731
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1269
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:12,959
There's a flooded tunnel,
leads right underneath that building.

1270
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,519
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim in underneath that thing's feet.

1271
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,599
We get in its face and distract the hell
out of that son of a bitch

1272
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,460
so the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1273
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,251
That's how we take it out.

1274
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,652
I'm going with ya.

1275
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,599
We got this.

1276
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,136
I'm not asking, bro.

1277
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,519
I live underground.

1278
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,329
Y'all are just tourists.

1279
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,814
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1280
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,730
His soul's trapped inside of it.

1281
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:26,132
She talks to him.

1282
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,879
Hey, well,

1283
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,610
you know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1284
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,180
Huh?

1285
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,889
Let's do this.

1286
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,179
You must really love this girl.

1287
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:28,777
Man, I thought love was bullshit.
Dead serious.

1288
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,974
Desire, mutual benefit, whatever.

1289
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,359
I mean, I get that, but actual love?

1290
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,771
I rated that with UFOs.

1291
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:42,220
Lot of believers, no proof.

1292
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,378
And then I met June.

1293
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,972
Do what you gotta do.

1294
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,934
I got your back.

1295
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,580
You gonna fight with us?

1296
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,119
What if I lose control?

1297
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,576
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1298
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,020
Duck in.

1299
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:41,479
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff, right?

1300
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,199
Yeah. Why?

1301
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,577
I'm off my meds.

1302
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,740
So that's your old lady, huh?

1303
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,159
Yeah.

1304
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,199
Well, you need to handle
this shit, all right?

1305
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:56,039
Get up there, smack on her ass,
tell her, "Knock this shit off."

1306
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,359
I do not think that'd be wise.

1307
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,559
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

1308
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,494
My boys will detonate the bomb
underneath him.

1309
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:10,368
You know, we should get a drink sometime.

1310
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:14,178
I've been waiting for you all night.

1311
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,413
Step out of the shadows. I won't bite.

1312
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,839
Hmm.

1313
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:25,171
What the hell? Grab her.

1314
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,679
Why are you here?

1315
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,999
Because the soldier led you?

1316
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,759
And all for Waller.

1317
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,919
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1318
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:39,359
I am your ally.

1319
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,959
And I know what you want.

1320
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:45,338
Exactly what you want.

1321
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,618
Baby. Baby.

1322
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,299
Baby, it's just a nightmare.

1323
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,298
It's just a bad dream.

1324
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,134
I'm here.

1325
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,055
Miss me?

1326
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,890
I'll put the kids to sleep
and then maybe we can kick it?

1327
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,740
Yeah?

1328
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:08,439
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!

1329
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,532
He married me!

1330
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:13,499
It's not real.

1331
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:14,879
I killed the Bat.

1332
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,972
Nah, homie. You don't want that.

1333
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:18,879
What? I want that.

1334
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,599
She trying to play games with you, man.

1335
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,818
- It's not real!
- He's right.

1336
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,854
It's not real.

1337
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:30,088
How long have you been able to see?

1338
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,219
My whole life.

1339
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:34,959
You can't have them.

1340
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,399
These are my people right here.

1341
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,359
But it is our time.

1342
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:43,695
The sun is setting, and the magic rises.
The metahumans are a sign of change.

1343
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,452
Lady, you are evil!

1344
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:54,689
Oh, wow.

1345
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,089
Uh-oh.

1346
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,168
Who's this?

1347
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,691
- It's gonna be bad!
- We should run.

1348
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,298
GQ, come in. We're in position.

1349
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,879
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

1350
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,098
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1351
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,599
I lost one family.
I ain't gonna lose another one.

1352
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,119
Look, think it through.

1353
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:51,930
I got this.
Let me show you what I really am.

1354
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,620
Over here!

1355
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,340
Go!

1356
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,919
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1357
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,251
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1358
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,169
- Get him, mate!
- Come on.

1359
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:15,539
Yeah, do it!

1360
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,359
Diablo, get clear! Get outta there!

1361
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,293
Blow it!

1362
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,529
Blow it.

1363
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:38,734
- Now, GQ. Now.
- No!

1364
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,608
Everybody, down!

1365
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:20,729
You next.

1366
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,119
My spell is complete.

1367
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:29,079
Once you and your armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1368
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:33,016
And it will be mine to rule.

1369
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,177
That was our main satellite uplink.

1370
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,639
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?

1371
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,971
It's a secret facility.

1372
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,199
You got a move here, Flag?

1373
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:07,736
We gotta cut her heart out.

1374
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,719
While we're fighting,

1375
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:42,495
that thing's laying waste
to the whole damn world.

1376
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:51,014
Where is she?

1377
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,900
I don't know.

1378
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,660
Hey.

1379
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,248
Look out. Look out!

1380
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:29,799
Uh-oh.

1381
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,528
Sorry.

1382
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,739
Flag!

1383
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,334
Enough!

1384
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:23,199
Of all who have faced me,
you have earned mercy.

1385
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,577
For the last time,

1386
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,457
join me, or die.

1387
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,374
I'm not much of a joiner,

1388
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,239
but maybe we should.

1389
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,799
Hey!

1390
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,639
She's trying to take over the world.

1391
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,255
So?

1392
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:46,091
What's the world ever done for us, anyway?
It hates us.

1393
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,539
Hey, Harley!

1394
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:54,653
Hey, lady? Um...

1395
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:58,457
I lost my Puddin'.

1396
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:01,732
But you can get him back, right?

1397
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,759
I can, my dear.

1398
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:07,933
Anything you want.

1399
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,679
You promise?

1400
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,898
Yes, child.

1401
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:16,979
You need only bow

1402
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:22,136
and serve beneath my feet.

1403
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,295
I like what you're sellin', lady.

1404
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:33,456
There's just one teeny problem.

1405
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,100
You messed with my friends.

1406
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:44,410
Her heart's out! We can end this!

1407
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,656
Hey, Croc!

1408
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,688
Harley!

1409
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,530
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

1410
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,894
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1411
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:49,412
Daddy, I love you.

1412
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,296
Please, don't do this.

1413
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,199
That was a great shot, man.

1414
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,559
Hey, I don't do hugs. I'm not a hugger.

1415
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,699
I'm not a hugger. All right?

1416
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,809
Let me join my brother.

1417
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:05,014
Katana, no!

1418
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:11,254
Give me that.

1419
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:15,799
You bring June back. You bring her back.

1420
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,919
She's not coming back.

1421
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,719
I'll crush this. Do you hear me?

1422
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,759
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1423
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:24,488
Go ahead.

1424
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,297
You don't have the balls.

1425
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:21,415
Hey, Flag.

1426
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,089
June!

1427
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,999
She's gone.

1428
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,776
I thought I killed you.

1429
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,959
Y'all don't mind,

1430
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,759
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1431
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:55,439
Yeah, and I got some business to handle
back in Gotham.

1432
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,279
I'm going to hotwire a car. Need a ride?

1433
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:58,719
Your ass is not driving.

1434
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,255
Why not?

1435
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,817
How are you not dead?

1436
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,132
We just saved the world.

1437
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,817
A "thank you" would be nice.

1438
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:11,575
Thank you.

1439
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,239
You're welcome.

1440
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,159
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1441
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:18,174
Ten years off your prison sentences.

1442
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,333
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1443
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,139
That can be arranged.

1444
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,779
Any other requests?

1445
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,978
Ooh. An espresso machine.

1446
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,618
BET.

1447
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,599
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1448
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,519
Darling, I'm walking
out of here a free man

1449
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,519
or we're going
to start having some real fun.

1450
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,931
Why don't we have some fun?

1451
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:57,380
You're trying to figure out this length.

1452
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,159
That's the hypotenuse.

1453
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:01,159
So, you have to know this angle.

1454
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:05,559
Okay. So, if you're up here,
like in a building,

1455
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,839
and you shoot a man
down here on the street,

1456
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:11,456
that's how far the bullet actually goes?

1457
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,999
Yeah. That's right.

1458
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,679
You are so smart. Right.

1459
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:18,819
The hypotenuse. Good one. Um...

1460
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,039
So, that would make you
have to know the angle

1461
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,519
between the building and the sidewalk.

1462
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,199
You got to know that angle.

1463
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:28,079
No, I mean, in real life,
you have variables.

1464
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,519
You know, you got rifling twist.

1465
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:32,375
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1466
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,999
Some shots you'll even
have to take the curvature

1467
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,039
of the Earth in with the...

1468
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,540
It's time.

1469
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,254
...wind effect.

1470
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,650
You know, there's a lot of variables

1471
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:47,379
in the street.

1472
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,369
I gotta go.

1473
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,699
Are you coming back?

1474
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:56,919
Yeah.

1475
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:59,679
I'm working it out. All right?

1476
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:03,799
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go,

1477
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,399
without killing them all.

1478
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,049
Bring it in.

1479
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,239
I love you, Daddy.

1480
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:13,740
Hmm.

1481
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,614
I love you.

1482
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:44,759
Hey! Let me out!

1483
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,799
Let me out of here right now!

1484
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:50,258
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1485
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:52,759
Let me out of here, darling, please.

1486
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:54,119
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1487
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:57,639
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1488
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,493
Come on!

1489
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:55,973
Puddin'!

1490
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,972
Let's go home.

1491
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:26,769
This is crown jewels here,
Mr. Wayne.

1492
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,479
And you do understand my legal exposure.

1493
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:31,679
If anyone knew what I procured for you...

1494
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,436
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?

1495
02:06:35,461 --> 02:06:36,479
What do you want?

1496
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,199
People are asking questions
about Midway City.

1497
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,959
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1498
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:44,199
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

1499
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,959
Consider yourself under my protection.

1500
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,734
If you deliver.

1501
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,581
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1502
02:07:08,304 --> 02:07:10,362
Just like to make friends.

1503
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,719
That's the difference between us.

1504
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:15,658
You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.

1505
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,599
Good night.

1506
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:19,666
You look tired.

1507
02:07:19,667 --> 02:07:22,283
You should stop working nights.

1508
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:27,556
You should shut it down,
or my friends and I'll do it for you.
