2
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,911
Master Kaecilius.

3
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:34,048
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

4
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:10,624
Hypocrite!

5
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,825
Challenge round, Billy.

6
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,154
Oh, come on, Billy, you've got
to be messing with me.

7
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:15,377
No, doctor.

8
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:18,409
<i>Feels</i> So <i>Good,</i> Chuck Mangione, 1977.

9
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,661
Honestly, Billy, you said
this one would be hard.

10
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:22,788
- Ha! It's 1978.
- No, Billy.

11
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,236
While Feels <i>So</i> Good
may have charted in 1978...

12
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:28,919
the album was released
in December of 1977.

13
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,588
No.
Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

14
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,714
Check again.

15
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:32,965
Where do you store

16
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,091
all this useless information?

17
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:35,259
Useless?

18
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,928
The man charted a top 10 hit
with a flugelhorn.

19
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,096
Status, Billy?

20
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,264
1977.

21
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:41,724
- Oh, please.
- I hate you.

22
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:42,850
Oh!

23
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:46,221
Feels so good, doesn't it?

24
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:50,024
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

25
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,702
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

26
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,070
What is it?

27
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,043
GSW.

28
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:57,990
It's amazing you kept him alive.

29
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,700
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

30
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:01,035
and the apnea reflex test.

31
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,871
I think I found the problem,
Doctor Palmer.

32
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,491
You left a bullet in his head.

33
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,249
Thanks.
It's impinging on the medulla.

34
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,752
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

35
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,587
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

36
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,389
We have to run.

37
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,383
Doctor West.

38
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:16,759
What are you doing? Hey.

39
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,294
Organ harvest.
He's a donor.

40
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,012
Slow down.
I did not agree to that.

41
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,014
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

42
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,140
Prematurely.
We need to get him prepped

43
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:24,475
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

44
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,394
Not gonna let you operate
on a dead man.

45
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,853
What do you see?

46
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,939
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet.

47
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,900
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet
by alloying lead with antimony.

48
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,696
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

49
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,322
Rapid onset central
nervous system shutdown.

50
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:39,573
We gotta go.

51
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:40,991
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.

52
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:43,214
Still want to harvest his organs?

53
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,079
- I'll assist you.
- No.

54
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,757
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

55
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:05,574
Thank you.

56
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,190
Image guidance, stat.

57
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,484
We don't have time for that.

58
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,694
You can't do it freehand.

59
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:18,070
I can and I will.

60
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,989
This isn't a time
for showing off, Strange.

61
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,073
How about 10 minutes ago

62
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,468
when you called
the wrong time of death?

63
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:35,021
<i>Cranial nerves intact.</i>

64
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,339
Doctor West, cover your watch.

65
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:46,951
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

66
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:48,536
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

67
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:51,330
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

68
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,790
Nic is a great doctor.

69
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,041
You came to me.

70
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,501
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

71
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,669
You had a second opinion.

72
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,170
What you needed was a competent one.

73
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,338
Well, all the more reason

74
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,464
why you should be
my neurosurgeon on call.

75
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,007
You could make such a difference.

76
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,676
I can't work in your butcher shop.

77
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,844
Hey!

78
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,011
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

79
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,264
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

80
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:10,641
The work I'm doing is gonna save
thousands for years to come.

81
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,143
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

82
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,270
Yeah, you're right.

83
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:15,813
In ER, we're only saving lives.

84
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,690
There's no fame, there's no, uh,

85
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,441
CNN interviews.

86
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,402
I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.

87
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:22,528
Whoa, wait a minute.

88
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,863
You're not...
You guys aren't...

89
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,197
What?

90
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,033
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

91
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,660
Explicit, actually.

92
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,996
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

93
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:33,080
Oh, really?

94
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:34,248
I call it the "Strange Policy."

95
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:37,376
Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

96
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,461
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

97
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,214
And yet, somehow no one seems to want
to call it the "Strange Technique."

98
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,924
We invented that technique.

99
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:47,103
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

100
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,807
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

101
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,225
Come with me.

102
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,019
Another speaking engagement?

103
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,270
So romantic.

104
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:58,105
You used to love coming
to those things with me.

105
00:09:58,106 --> 00:09:59,440
We had fun together.

106
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:01,191
No! You had fun.

107
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:03,790
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

108
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,404
Not only about me.

109
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,866
Stephen.
Everything is about you.

110
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,910
Maybe we could hyphenate.

111
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,078
Strange-Palmer Technique.

112
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,677
Palmer-Strange.

113
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,505
Billy.

114
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:05,631
What have you got for me?

115
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,299
<i>I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...</i>

116
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,260
<i>crushed his lower spine
in some kind of experimental armor.</i>

117
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,845
<i>Mid-thoracic burst fracture.</i>

118
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,430
Yeah, well, I could help...

119
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,765
but so could 50 other people.

120
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:16,392
Find me something worth my time.

121
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:20,270
<i>I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.</i>

122
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:22,564
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record?

123
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,024
Definitely not.

124
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,145
<i>How about a 22-year-old female...</i>

125
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,696
<i>with an electronic implant in her brain
to control schizophrenia...</i>

126
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:29,989
<i>struck by lightning?</i>

127
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,337
Mmm.
That does sound interesting.

128
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:35,035
Can you send me the...

129
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,554
Got it.

130
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,359
Hey.

131
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:44,159
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

132
00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:00,175
What did they do?

133
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:02,915
They rushed you in a chopper.

134
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,810
But it took a little while
to find you.

135
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:09,338
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

136
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,813
What did they do?

137
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:18,689
<i>11 stainless steel pins in the bones.</i>

138
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,741
Multiple torn ligaments...

139
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,912
severe nerve damage in both hands.

140
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,689
You were on the table for 11 hours.

141
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,413
Look at these fixators.

142
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,004
No one could have done better.

143
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:42,346
I could have done better.

144
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,483
No.

145
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,707
Give your body time to heal.

146
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,123
You've ruined me.

147
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:19,908
How long until I can take...

148
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,076
Doctor Strange.

149
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:22,786
Those tissues are still healing.

150
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:24,079
So, speed it up.

151
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,474
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

152
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,551
It's possible.

153
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:33,130
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

154
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,604
All I need is possible.

155
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,165
Up.

156
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:02,451
Up.

157
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,129
Show me your strength.

158
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,935
This is useless.

159
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:15,181
It's not useless, man.
You can do this.

160
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:18,133
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

161
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,719
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage

162
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,471
this severe to do this...

163
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:23,722
and actually recover?

164
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,349
One guy, yeah.

165
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,893
Factory accident, broke his back...

166
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,437
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

167
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:31,730
He had pain in his shoulder,

168
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,023
from the wheelchair.

169
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,484
He came in three times a week.

170
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:36,902
Then one day he stopped coming.

171
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,820
I thought he was dead.

172
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:41,156
A few years later, he walked
past me on the street.

173
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,574
- Walked?
- Yeah, walked.

174
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,786
Bullshit.
Show me his file.

175
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:48,330
It'll take me a while to
pull the files from the archive.

176
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:51,333
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

177
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:53,306
Worth it.

178
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:09,518
<i>I looked at all your research...</i>

179
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,895
<i>I read all the papers you've sent.</i>

180
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,772
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

181
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,357
<i>I don't think you realize...</i>

182
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,943
<i>- how severe the damages are.
- Here's the thing...</i>

183
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,528
<i>The best have tried and failed.</i>

184
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,239
I understand.
Here's the thing.

185
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,533
<i>What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.</i>

186
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:25,701
Come on.

187
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,536
<i>I've got my own reputation to consider.</i>

188
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,496
- Etienne, wait. No.
- I can't help you.

189
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:31,657
No, no, wait!

190
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,597
Hey!

191
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,567
He won't do it.

192
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,530
He's a hack.

193
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,477
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

194
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,062
They culture donor stem cells...

195
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,480
and then harvesting them

196
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,898
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

197
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,150
If I could get a loan together...

198
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,318
Stephen.

199
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,069
A small loan, just $200,000.

200
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,113
You've always spent money
<i>as</i> fast as you could make it...

201
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:05,574
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

202
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:08,744
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

203
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:11,580
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

204
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,583
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

205
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,501
But this isn't medicine anymore.

206
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,895
This is mania.

207
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:21,089
Some things just can't be fixed.

208
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,717
- Life without my work...
- ls still life.

209
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:24,760
This isn't the end.

210
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:27,929
There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

211
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,323
Like what?
Like you?

212
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:34,519
This is the part where you apologize.

213
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,038
This is the part where you leave.

214
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:40,067
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

215
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:41,610
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

216
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:43,612
Yes, it is.

217
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:46,031
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

218
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,367
- No, don't pity me.
- I'm not pitying you.

219
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,534
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

220
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,870
bringing cheese and wine
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

221
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,372
We are not friends, Christine.

222
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,623
We were barely lovers.

223
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:56,750
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

224
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:58,043
Is that what I am to you now?

225
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,879
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

226
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,963
"He finally needs me."

227
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,757
Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

228
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:06,218
Patch him up and send him
back into the world...

229
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,803
heart's just humming.

230
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:11,949
You care so much, don't you?

231
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,447
Goodbye, Stephen.

232
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,487
All the way.
Here we go.

233
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:09,531
Let's go!
All day! All day!

234
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:12,742
Yeah!
All day.

235
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:15,623
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

236
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,837
Talk a lot.

237
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,834
Jonathan Pangborn...

238
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:24,379
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

239
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,547
Who are you?

240
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:26,798
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

241
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,592
Partial paralysis in both hands.

242
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:30,760
- I don't know you.
- I'm Stephen Strange.

243
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:34,531
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

244
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:37,601
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

245
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,479
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

246
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,702
I never got past your assistant.

247
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,567
You were untreatable.

248
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:48,370
No glory for you in that, right?

249
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:52,625
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

250
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,298
I'm trying to
find my own way back.

251
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,311
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

252
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,903
All right.

253
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:16,932
I'd given up on my body.

254
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,934
I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

255
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:21,436
I should at least try to elevate that.

256
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:23,605
So, I sat with gurus...

257
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:25,398
and sacred women.

258
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:28,443
Strangers carried me to
mountaintops to see holy men.

259
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:29,778
And finally...

260
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,447
I found my teacher.

261
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,116
And my mind was elevated...

262
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,089
and my spirit deepened.

263
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:38,411
And somehow...

264
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:39,621
Your body healed.

265
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:41,423
Yes.

266
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,417
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

267
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:46,253
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

268
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:49,853
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

269
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:57,681
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

270
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:59,140
But the cost there is high.

271
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,017
How much?

272
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:03,491
I'm not talking about money.

273
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,957
Good luck.

274
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:11,248
Let's ball.
All right, ball up!

275
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,924
Uh, Kamar-Taj?

276
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,228
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

277
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,678
Kamar-Taj?

278
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:04,514
Kamar-Taj.

279
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,085
Okay.

280
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,615
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

281
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:39,949
Your watch.

282
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,119
No, please.
It's all I have left.

283
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,967
Your watch.

284
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,558
All right.

285
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,931
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

286
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,658
Really?

287
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,827
Sure we got the right place?

288
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:10,132
That one looks
a little more Kamar-Tajey.

289
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:14,669
I once stood in your place.

290
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,270
And I, too, was disrespectful.

291
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,648
So, might I offer you some advice?

292
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:26,023
Forget everything you think you know.

293
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:30,034
All right.

294
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,987
The sanctuary of our teacher.

295
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:42,572
The Ancient One.

296
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:44,073
The Ancient One?

297
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:46,000
What's his real name?

298
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:48,077
Right.

299
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:51,347
Forget everything I think I know.
Sorry.

300
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:03,894
Um, thank you for...
Whoa!

301
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,235
Okay, that's a thing.

302
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:09,933
Thank you for...

303
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,735
Hello.

304
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,895
Oh, thank you.

305
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:15,563
And thank you.

306
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:17,524
Uh, thank you...

307
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:20,401
Ancient One, for seeing me.

308
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:23,204
You're very welcome.

309
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:26,282
The Ancient One.

310
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:29,369
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

311
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,204
Mr. Strange.

312
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:33,414
Uh... Doctor, actually.

313
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:35,917
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

314
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:37,794
Isn't that why you're here?

315
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:39,796
You've undergone many procedures.

316
00:25:39,797 --> 00:25:42,816
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

317
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:45,093
It's good tea.

318
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:46,895
Yes.

319
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:53,309
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

320
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,435
A paralyzed man?

321
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:55,645
In a way.

322
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,647
You helped him to walk again.

323
00:25:57,648 --> 00:25:58,940
Yes.

324
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:02,652
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

325
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:04,571
Well, I didn't correct it.

326
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:06,072
He couldn't walk.

327
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:07,657
I convinced him that he could.

328
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:09,576
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

329
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:11,786
When you reattach a severed nerve...

330
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,163
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

331
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:15,456
It's the cells.

332
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:16,916
The cells are only programmed...

333
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:19,085
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

334
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:20,128
Right.

335
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,839
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

336
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,769
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

337
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:30,305
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

338
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:32,765
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

339
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,684
Is that why you're working here?

340
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:37,312
Without a governing medical board?

341
00:26:37,313 --> 00:26:39,706
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

342
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:41,783
Quite.

343
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,860
So, you've figured out a way...

344
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:46,959
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

345
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,503
No, Mr. Strange.

346
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:52,368
I know how to reorient the spirit...

347
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,796
to better heal the body.

348
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:59,305
- The spirit to heal the body?
- That's right.

349
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:02,795
No.
All right.

350
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:04,005
How do we do that?

351
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:06,274
Where do we start?

352
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:13,181
- Don't like that map?
- Oh, no.

353
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:16,351
It's really good. It's just,
I've seen it before...

354
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,404
in gift shops.

355
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:21,397
And what about this one?

356
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,166
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

357
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:26,694
What about that one?

358
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:29,697
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

359
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:32,200
Each of those maps
was drawn up by someone...

360
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:35,328
who could see in part, but not the whole.

361
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,413
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

362
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:40,875
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

363
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,503
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

364
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:45,088
You've spent your whole life

365
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,255
trying to widen that keyhole...

366
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,341
to see more, to know more.

367
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:51,344
Now, on hearing that
it can be widened...

368
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:53,221
in ways you can't imagine...

369
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:55,223
you reject the possibility.

370
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:57,392
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

371
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:59,310
about chakras or energy...

372
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,062
or the power of belief.

373
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:03,731
There is no such thing as spirit!

374
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:06,901
We are made of matter
and nothing more.

375
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:10,071
You're just another tiny,
momentary speck

376
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:11,572
within an indifferent universe.

377
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,366
You think too little of yourself.

378
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:15,368
Oh, you think
you see through me, do you?

379
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:16,619
Well, you don't.

380
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,219
But I see through you!

381
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:38,725
What did you just do to me?

382
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,977
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

383
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:42,562
What's in that tea?

384
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:44,564
Psilocybin?
LSD?

385
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:46,149
It's just tea...

386
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,817
with a little honey.

387
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,152
What just happened?

388
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:51,571
For a moment, you entered
the astral dimension.

389
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:52,780
The what?

390
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,908
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

391
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:57,869
Why are you doing this to me?

392
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,093
To show you
just how much you don't know.

393
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:03,223
Open your eye.

394
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:09,922
Oh, shit!

395
00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:12,467
Oh, God!
Oh, God, no!

396
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,010
No, no, no!

397
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:15,178
What's happening?

398
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,073
This isn't real!

399
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:31,627
<i>His heart rate
is getting dangerously high.</i>

400
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:37,963
He looks all right to me.

401
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:42,663
<i>You think
you know how the world works?</i>

402
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:46,684
<i>You think that this material universe
is all there is?</i>

403
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,482
<i>What is real?</i>

404
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:58,196
<i>What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?</i>

405
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:02,058
<i>At the root of existence...</i>

406
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,561
<i>mind and matter meet.</i>

407
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:08,990
<i>Thoughts shape reality.</i>

408
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,378
On!

409
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:25,598
<i>This universe is only one
of an infinite number.</i>

410
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:30,345
<i>Worlds without end.</i>

411
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:33,557
<i>Some benevolent and life giving.</i>

412
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:40,192
<i>Others filled with malice and hunger.</i>

413
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,432
<i>Dark places...</i>

414
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:49,034
<i>where powers older than time
lie ravenous...</i>

415
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,954
<i>and waiting.</i>

416
00:30:58,949 --> 00:31:05,802
<i>Who are you
in this vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange?</i>

417
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:28,987
Have you seen
that before in a gift shop?

418
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,207
Teach me.

419
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:40,961
No.

420
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,079
No.

421
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,247
No!

422
00:31:48,248 --> 00:31:51,096
No, no, no!

423
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:53,628
No!

424
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:56,727
Open the door!
Please!

425
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,278
Thank you, Masters.

426
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:08,100
You think I was wrong
to cast him out?

427
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:11,199
5 hours later,
he's still on your doorstep.

428
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,356
There's a strength to him.

429
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:16,067
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

430
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,541
I've seen it all before.

431
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,030
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

432
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:23,950
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

433
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:27,004
only to lose him to the darkness.

434
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,456
You didn't lose me.

435
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:32,416
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

436
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:36,212
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

437
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:39,340
And to live within the natural law.

438
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:42,468
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

439
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:45,317
We only learn to live above them.

440
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,184
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

441
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,520
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

442
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:54,743
upon us all.

443
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:57,525
There may be dark days ahead.

444
00:32:57,526 --> 00:33:01,455
Perhaps Kamar-Taj
could use a man like Strange.

445
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,382
Don't shut me out.

446
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,264
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

447
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,185
Thank you.

448
00:33:28,724 --> 00:33:30,571
Bathe.

449
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,909
Rest.

450
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:34,603
Meditate...

451
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:36,605
if you can.

452
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:39,454
The Ancient One will send for you.

453
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:48,547
What's this'?
My mantra?

454
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:52,885
The Wi-Fi password.

455
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,096
We're not savages.

456
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:28,949
<i>The language
of the mystic arts...</i>

457
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,869
<i>is as old as civilization.</i>

458
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,121
The sorcerers of antiquity...

459
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:37,124
called the use of this language "spells."

460
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:39,210
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

461
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,171
you can call it a "program."

462
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:45,549
The source code that shapes reality.

463
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,647
We harness energy...

464
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,279
drawn from other dimensions
of the Multiverse...

465
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:56,361
to cast spells...

466
00:34:57,187 --> 00:34:59,980
to conjure shields...

467
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:02,624
and weapons...

468
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:04,790
to make magic.

469
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:22,837
But even if my fingers
could do that...

470
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:25,840
my hands would just be
waving in the air.

471
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:28,175
How do I get from here to there?

472
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:31,595
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

473
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,432
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

474
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:37,782
Study and practice, years of it.

475
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,161
Hey.

476
00:35:50,073 --> 00:35:51,949
Mr. Strange.

477
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,701
Uh, Stephen, please.

478
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:55,953
- And you are?
- Wong.

479
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,705
Wong.

480
00:35:57,706 --> 00:35:59,123
Just Wong?

481
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,597
Like Adele?

482
00:36:02,752 --> 00:36:05,179
Or Aristotle.

483
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,548
Drake.

484
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:09,396
Bono.

485
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:12,853
Eminem.

486
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:18,726
<i>The Book of the Invisible Sun.</i>

487
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:20,895
<i>Astronomia Nova.</i>

488
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:22,730
<i>Codex Imperium.</i>

489
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:25,249
<i>Key of Solomon.</i>

490
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,360
You finished all of these?

491
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:30,070
Yup.

492
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,238
Come with me.

493
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,131
All right.

494
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,451
This section
is for masters only...

495
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:38,630
but at my discretion,
others may use it.

496
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,224
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

497
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:46,638
How's your Sanskrit?

498
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:50,257
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

499
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:53,607
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

500
00:36:56,806 --> 00:36:58,607
What are those?

501
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,727
The Ancient One's
private collection.

502
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:03,395
So, they're forbidden?

503
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:05,773
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj
is forbidden.

504
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:08,372
Only certain practices.

505
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:10,486
Those books are far too advanced

506
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:13,381
for anyone other than
the Sorcerer Supreme.

507
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:26,961
This one's got pages missing.

508
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:29,255
<i>That's The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

509
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:31,257
A study of time.

510
00:37:31,258 --> 00:37:34,686
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

511
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,489
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

512
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:42,017
Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

513
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:45,116
and relieved him of his head.

514
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:49,358
I am now the guardian of these books.

515
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,987
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

516
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:54,613
I'd know it...

517
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:58,338
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

518
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,664
What if it's just overdue?

519
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,505
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

520
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:12,631
People used to think that I was funny.

521
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:14,049
Did they work for you?

522
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,343
All right. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you.

523
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:18,012
Thank you for the books...

524
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:20,306
and for the horrifying story...

525
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:22,950
and for the threat upon my life.

526
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,341
We will now receive the power

527
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:58,019
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

528
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,698
The one who betrays the world.

529
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:05,369
Mastery of the sling ring
is essential to the mystic arts.

530
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,548
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

531
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,092
All you need to do is focus.

532
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:12,835
Visualize.

533
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:16,380
See the destination in your mind.

534
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:19,730
Look beyond the world in front of you.

535
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,736
Imagine every detail.

536
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:27,808
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

537
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:30,452
the gateway will come.

538
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,481
And stop.

539
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:37,818
I would like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

540
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,711
Of course.

541
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,408
My hands.

542
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,826
It's not about your hands.

543
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:48,033
How is this not about my hands?

544
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,229
Master Hamir.

545
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:06,146
Thank you, Master Hamir.

546
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:09,516
You cannot beat a river into submission.

547
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,602
You have to surrender to its current...

548
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,021
and use its power as your own.

549
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:16,273
I control it by surrendering control?

550
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,605
That doesn't make any sense.

551
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:20,986
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

552
00:41:20,987 --> 00:41:23,655
Your intellect has
taken you far in life...

553
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:25,616
but it will take you no further.

554
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:28,076
Surrender, Stephen.

555
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:30,144
Silence your ego...

556
00:41:30,145 --> 00:41:32,706
and your power will rise.

557
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,850
Come with me.

558
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:40,339
Wait.

559
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,108
- Is this...
- Everest.

560
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:45,010
Beautiful.

561
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:47,721
Yeah, right, beautiful.

562
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:50,307
Freezing but beautiful.

563
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,683
At this temperature...

564
00:41:51,684 --> 00:41:53,894
a person can last for 30 minutes...

565
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:56,730
before suffering permanent
loss of function.

566
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:57,815
Great.

567
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:01,085
But you'll likely go into shock
within the first two.

568
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,862
- What?
- Surrender, Stephen.

569
00:42:03,863 --> 00:42:05,710
No!

570
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:16,500
How's our new recruit?

571
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,836
We shall see.

572
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,355
Any second now.

573
00:42:22,715 --> 00:42:24,732
Oh, no, not again.

574
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:31,065
Maybe I should...

575
00:43:44,464 --> 00:43:45,756
Stephen.

576
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:46,840
Wong.

577
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:47,883
What do you want, Strange?

578
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:50,106
Books on astral projection.

579
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:52,012
You're not ready for that.

580
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:54,611
Try me, Beyoncé.

581
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,352
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

582
00:43:58,353 --> 00:44:00,530
She's a huge star, right?

583
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:04,499
Do you ever laugh?

584
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:07,370
Oh, come on,
 just give me the book.

585
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,504
No.

586
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:37,891
Once, in <i>this</i> room,

587
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:40,686
<i>you begged me to let you learn.</i>

588
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:43,313
Now, I'm told
you question every lesson...

589
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,190
preferring to teach yourself.

590
00:44:45,191 --> 00:44:46,984
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eye.

591
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:49,111
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

592
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:50,737
that make no sense.

593
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:53,782
Like the rule against
conjuring a gateway in the library?

594
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:55,409
Wong told on me?

595
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,911
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

596
00:44:57,912 --> 00:45:01,386
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

597
00:45:19,058 --> 00:45:21,393
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

598
00:45:21,394 --> 00:45:24,104
ever present but undetected.

599
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:26,907
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

600
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:32,029
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil...

601
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,448
and sometimes to contain threats.

602
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:36,783
You don't wanna be stuck in here
without your sling ring.

603
00:45:36,784 --> 00:45:40,303
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

604
00:45:49,422 --> 00:45:54,068
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

605
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:56,636
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

606
00:45:56,637 --> 00:45:58,984
you'd run from here in terror.

607
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,451
So just how ancient is she?

608
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:12,161
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

609
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,489
Only that she's Celtic
and never talks about her past.

610
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,407
You follow her, even though
you don't know?

611
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:18,658
I know she's steadfast...

612
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:20,243
but unpredictable.

613
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,341
Merciless, yet kind.

614
00:46:23,706 --> 00:46:25,974
She made me what I am.

615
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,977
Trust your teacher...

616
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,337
and don't lose your way.

617
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:31,755
Like Kaecilius?

618
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,557
That's right.

619
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:39,522
You knew him.

620
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:41,765
When he first came to us...

621
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,683
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

622
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:47,437
He was a grieving, broken man
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

623
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:51,441
A brilliant student,
but he was proud, headstrong.

624
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:54,322
He questioned the Ancient One,
rejected her teaching.

625
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,036
He left Kamar-Taj.

626
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:05,664
His disciples followed him like sheep.

627
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:07,707
Seduced by false doctrine.

628
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,210
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

629
00:47:10,211 --> 00:47:11,378
Yes.

630
00:47:11,379 --> 00:47:13,351
What did it do?

631
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:17,025
No more questions.

632
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:18,885
What's that?

633
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:20,938
That's a question.

634
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:23,890
This is a relic.

635
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:25,892
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

636
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:27,893
so we imbue objects with it...

637
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,564
allowing them
to take the strain we cannot.

638
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:33,608
This is the staff...

639
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:36,002
of the Living Tribunal.

640
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,907
There are many relics.

641
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:42,409
The Wand of Watoomb.

642
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,953
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

643
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:47,506
Really just roll off
the tongue, don't they?

644
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:49,875
- When do I get my relic?
- When you're ready.

645
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:51,168
I think I'm ready.

646
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,421
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

647
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:56,474
For now...

648
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,475
conjure a weapon.

649
00:47:59,427 --> 00:48:01,228
All right.

650
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,743
Fight!

651
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,371
Fight like your life depended on it.

652
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:18,445
Because one day...

653
00:48:18,446 --> 00:48:20,463
it may.

654
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:31,818
Wong?

655
00:49:43,698 --> 00:49:45,365
Okay.

656
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:49,716
"First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

657
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:11,115
All right.

658
00:50:33,622 --> 00:50:35,765
<i>Oh, my.</i>

659
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,405
What if...

660
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:14,672
"Dormammu."

661
00:51:15,623 --> 00:51:17,595
"The Dark Dimension."

662
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,018
Eternal life?

663
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,317
- What the...
- Stop!

664
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:33,223
Tampering with continuum probabilities
is forbidden.

665
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:35,892
I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book.

666
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:37,102
What did the book say

667
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:38,686
about the dangers
of performing that ritual?

668
00:51:38,687 --> 00:51:40,355
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

669
00:51:40,356 --> 00:51:43,525
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

670
00:51:43,526 --> 00:51:45,944
Unstable dimensional openings.

671
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:48,321
Spatial paradoxes!
Time loops!

672
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:50,573
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

673
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,741
over and over forever...

674
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,885
or never having existed at all?

675
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,830
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

676
00:51:56,831 --> 00:51:59,082
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

677
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,292
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum...

678
00:52:01,293 --> 00:52:03,094
you were breaking it.

679
00:52:03,712 --> 00:52:05,755
We do not tamper with natural law.

680
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:07,006
We defend it.

681
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:08,633
How did you even do that?

682
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:09,968
Hmm?

683
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:13,096
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

684
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,180
I've got a photographic memory.

685
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:16,266
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

686
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,435
What you just did...

687
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:20,395
takes more than a good memory.

688
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:22,188
You were born for the mystic arts.

689
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:24,607
And yet my hands still shake.

690
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,859
For now, yes.

691
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,277
Not forever?

692
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:28,528
We're not prophets.

693
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:31,209
When are you gonna start
telling me what we are?

694
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,370
While heroes like the Avengers

695
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,747
protect the world
from physical dangers...

696
00:52:39,748 --> 00:52:44,018
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

697
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,880
The Ancient One
is the latest in a long line

698
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,548
of Sorcerers Supreme...

699
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:52,051
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

700
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,978
the mighty Agamotto.

701
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:59,117
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

702
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,396
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

703
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:05,565
where great cities now stand.

704
00:53:05,566 --> 00:53:08,485
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

705
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:11,070
That door to the New York Sanctum.

706
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:13,111
That one to the London Sanctum.

707
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,741
Together...

708
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:18,578
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

709
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:20,413
The Sanctums
protect the world...

710
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:22,415
and we sorcerers...

711
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:23,917
protect the Sanctums.

712
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:26,085
From what?

713
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:29,297
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

714
00:53:29,298 --> 00:53:31,224
Like Dormammu.

715
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:34,010
Where did you learn that name?

716
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:37,985
<i>I just read it in
The Book of Cagliostro. Why?</i>

717
00:53:42,394 --> 00:53:45,743
Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

718
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:47,899
Beyond time.

719
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,026
He is the cosmic conqueror...

720
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,445
the destroyer of worlds.

721
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:55,865
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

722
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,368
on a quest to invade every universe...

723
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:01,888
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

724
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:05,767
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

725
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,795
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

726
00:54:08,796 --> 00:54:10,964
A ritual to contact Dormammu

727
00:54:10,965 --> 00:54:13,285
and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

728
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:19,305
Uh... Okay...

729
00:54:19,306 --> 00:54:21,951
Um... I'm out.

730
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:25,228
I came here to heal my hands.

731
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:29,329
Not to fight in some mystical war.

732
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,626
London.

733
00:54:36,657 --> 00:54:37,949
Kaecilius!

734
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,751
No!

735
00:54:45,207 --> 00:54:47,850
Wong?
Mordo?

736
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,857
Hello?

737
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:10,216
Hello?

738
00:56:48,122 --> 00:56:52,552
Daniel, I see they made you
master of this Sanctum.

739
00:56:52,835 --> 00:56:55,461
You know what that means?

740
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:57,935
That you'll die protecting it.

741
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:15,164
Stop!

742
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:28,327
How long have you been
at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

743
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:30,254
Doctor.

744
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,457
Mister Doctor?

745
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,805
It's Strange.

746
00:57:35,627 --> 00:57:39,029
Maybe.
Who am I to judge?

747
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,285
Ha!

748
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,918
You don't know how to use that, do you?

749
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:08,083
Uh...

750
01:01:50,257 --> 01:01:52,525
What?

751
01:01:56,763 --> 01:01:58,222
Oh, stop it.

752
01:01:58,223 --> 01:01:59,432
I said stop it.

753
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:01,058
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

754
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:03,561
I don't even know what "this" is.

755
01:02:03,562 --> 01:02:04,937
It's the end...

756
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:06,772
and the beginning.

757
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:10,326
The many becoming the few
becoming the One.

758
01:02:11,236 --> 01:02:12,778
If you're not gonna start making sense...

759
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:14,613
I'm just gonna to have to
put this thing back on.

760
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:16,323
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

761
01:02:16,324 --> 01:02:19,410
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

762
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:21,120
- You are a doctor?
- Yeah.

763
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:22,663
A scientist.

764
01:02:22,664 --> 01:02:24,582
You understand the laws of nature.

765
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:27,835
All things age.
All things die.

766
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:29,462
In the end, our sun burns out.

767
01:02:29,463 --> 01:02:32,339
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

768
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,392
But the Dark Dimension...

769
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,677
it's a place beyond time.

770
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:38,262
That's it.
I'm putting this thing back on.

771
01:02:38,263 --> 01:02:39,930
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

772
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:42,683
This world can take its rightful place
alongside so many others...

773
01:02:42,684 --> 01:02:44,643
as part of the One.

774
01:02:44,644 --> 01:02:47,271
The great and beautiful One.

775
01:02:47,272 --> 01:02:49,315
We can all live forever.

776
01:02:49,316 --> 01:02:51,288
Really?

777
01:02:52,694 --> 01:02:56,543
What do you have to gain
out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

778
01:02:56,823 --> 01:02:58,074
The same as you.

779
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:01,410
The same as everyone.
Life. Eternal life.

780
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,579
People think in terms of good and evil...

781
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,414
when really time
is the true enemy of us all.

782
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,374
Time kills everything.

783
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:09,251
What about the people you killed?

784
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,419
Tiny-

785
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,689
Momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

786
01:03:15,008 --> 01:03:17,685
Yes.
You see.

787
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:20,346
You see what we're doing.

788
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:22,181
The world is not what it ought to be.

789
01:03:22,182 --> 01:03:24,767
Humanity longs for the eternal...

790
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:27,561
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

791
01:03:27,562 --> 01:03:29,897
Time is an insult.

792
01:03:29,898 --> 01:03:32,325
Death is an insult.

793
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,995
Doctor...

794
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:37,738
we don't seek to rule this world.

795
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:39,073
We seek to save it...

796
01:03:39,074 --> 01:03:43,378
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

797
01:03:43,578 --> 01:03:46,221
the why of all existence.

798
01:03:46,414 --> 01:03:50,138
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

799
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,379
What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

800
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:55,422
Was it enlightenment?

801
01:03:55,423 --> 01:03:57,440
Power?

802
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:01,691
You came to be healed, <i>as</i> did we all.

803
01:04:02,722 --> 01:04:05,307
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

804
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,393
We all come with the promise
of being healed...

805
01:04:07,394 --> 01:04:11,038
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

806
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:14,150
The real magic she keeps for herself.

807
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:18,296
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

808
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:25,411
I saw the rituals
in The Book of Cagliostro.

809
01:04:25,412 --> 01:04:27,913
So, you know.

810
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:29,582
The ritual gives me the power

811
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,000
to overthrow The Ancient One...

812
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,835
and tear her Sanctums down.

813
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:35,588
To let the Dark Dimension in.

814
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:37,882
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

815
01:04:37,883 --> 01:04:40,105
Dormammu gives freely.

816
01:04:40,135 --> 01:04:42,428
Life everlasting.

817
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:44,847
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

818
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,571
He's the savior of worlds.

819
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:49,143
No. I mean, come on.

820
01:04:49,144 --> 01:04:51,437
Look at your face.

821
01:04:51,438 --> 01:04:53,606
Dormammu made you a murderer.

822
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:56,626
Just how good can his kingdom be?

823
01:04:57,777 --> 01:04:59,778
You think that's funny?

824
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:01,614
No, not that.

825
01:05:01,615 --> 01:05:04,838
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

826
01:06:12,394 --> 01:06:13,560
Sir, can I help you?

827
01:06:13,561 --> 01:06:14,937
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

828
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:16,522
- Sir. We need to get...
- Where is she?

829
01:06:16,523 --> 01:06:18,107
The nurse's station.

830
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:20,000
Christine!

831
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:22,444
Stephen?

832
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:23,612
Oh, my God.

833
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:26,282
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

834
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:28,033
Now! I haven't any time.

835
01:06:28,034 --> 01:06:29,201
What happened?

836
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:32,972
I was stabbed.
Cardiac tamponade.

837
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:35,508
What are you wearing?

838
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:42,423
Chest cavity is clear.

839
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:45,977
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

840
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:49,388
<i>No, no, no.</i>

841
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:51,190
Stephen?

842
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:53,992
Come on, come on.

843
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:21,937
Just a little higher.

844
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,540
Please be careful with the needle.

845
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,476
Stephen?

846
01:07:29,429 --> 01:07:30,679
What am I seeing?

847
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,278
My astral body.

848
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:35,059
Are you dead?

849
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,453
No, Christine.
But I am dying.

850
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:41,532
Right.

851
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:43,942
Yeah.
All right.

852
01:07:43,943 --> 01:07:45,744
Okay.

853
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:51,008
Oh, wow.

854
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:57,206
I've never seen a wound like this.

855
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,166
What were you stabbed with?

856
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,184
I don't know.

857
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,147
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

858
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:23,440
What?

859
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:25,788
Keep me alive, will you?

860
01:08:26,111 --> 01:08:28,070
Huh?

861
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:30,919
Okay.

862
01:08:31,116 --> 01:08:33,418
Uh-huh.

863
01:08:54,556 --> 01:08:56,448
Oh, shit.

864
01:09:32,927 --> 01:09:35,274
Come on, come on.

865
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:41,448
Stephen, come on.

866
01:09:43,354 --> 01:09:44,855
Hit me again.

867
01:09:44,856 --> 01:09:46,732
Stop doing that!

868
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:48,484
Up the voltage and hit me again.

869
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:49,693
No, your heart's beating!

870
01:09:49,694 --> 01:09:51,695
Just do it!

871
01:09:51,696 --> 01:09:54,248
Oh, my God.

872
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:24,686
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

873
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,854
Are you okay?

874
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,022
Yeah.

875
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:28,943
Okay.

876
01:10:34,572 --> 01:10:36,782
After all this time...

877
01:10:36,783 --> 01:10:39,381
you just show up here...

878
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:42,371
flying out of your body.

879
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:44,248
Yeah, I know.

880
01:10:44,249 --> 01:10:46,596
I missed you, too, by the way.

881
01:10:46,668 --> 01:10:47,834
Ha ha.

882
01:10:47,835 --> 01:10:50,546
I wrote you emails,
but you never responded.

883
01:10:50,547 --> 01:10:52,599
Why would I?

884
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:55,813
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

885
01:10:56,094 --> 01:10:58,136
For all of it.
You were right.

886
01:10:58,137 --> 01:11:01,807
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

887
01:11:01,808 --> 01:11:04,476
And you deserved so much more.

888
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:06,654
Stop.
You're clearly in shock.

889
01:11:07,772 --> 01:11:10,274
What the hell is happening?

890
01:11:10,275 --> 01:11:12,372
Where have you been?

891
01:11:12,527 --> 01:11:15,737
Well, after Western medicine failed me...

892
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,991
I headed east,
and I ended up in Kathmandu.

893
01:11:18,992 --> 01:11:20,033
Kathmandu?

894
01:11:20,034 --> 01:11:22,131
Yeah.

895
01:11:22,203 --> 01:11:23,829
Like the Bob Seger song?

896
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,831
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A.
Yeah.

897
01:11:25,832 --> 01:11:29,626
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

898
01:11:29,627 --> 01:11:34,006
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

899
01:11:34,007 --> 01:11:35,507
Oh.
So you joined a cult.

900
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:38,302
No, I didn't.
No, not exactly. No.

901
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:41,138
They did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

902
01:11:41,139 --> 01:11:42,681
Yeah.
That sounds like a cult.

903
01:11:42,682 --> 01:11:44,099
It's not a cult.

904
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,601
Well, that's what a cultist would say.

905
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,185
Oh, no.

906
01:11:47,186 --> 01:11:49,896
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

907
01:11:49,897 --> 01:11:52,324
I'm late for a cult meeting.

908
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,486
This is insane.

909
01:11:56,487 --> 01:11:57,654
Yeah.

910
01:11:57,655 --> 01:12:00,198
- Where are you going?
- Um...

911
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:01,908
Can you tell me the truth?

912
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:04,369
Well, a powerful sorcerer

913
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,163
who gave himself over
to an ancient entity...

914
01:12:06,164 --> 01:12:08,874
can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me.

915
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,751
But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village...

916
01:12:10,752 --> 01:12:13,337
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

917
01:12:13,338 --> 01:12:14,504
that I opened up in the mop closet.

918
01:12:14,505 --> 01:12:17,182
Okay.
Don't tell me. Fine.

919
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:29,327
Really do have to go.

920
01:12:29,604 --> 01:12:31,496
Yeah.

921
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:18,368
Strange!

922
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:21,571
You're okay.

923
01:13:21,572 --> 01:13:24,449
A relative term.
But yeah, I'm okay.

924
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,002
The Cloak of Levitation.

925
01:13:27,245 --> 01:13:29,496
It came to you.

926
01:13:29,497 --> 01:13:31,719
No minor feat.

927
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,500
It's a fickle thing.

928
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:35,752
- He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?

929
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:37,337
Yeah.

930
01:13:37,338 --> 01:13:39,798
He can fold space and matter at will.

931
01:13:39,799 --> 01:13:43,343
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

932
01:13:43,344 --> 01:13:44,636
in the real world?

933
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:45,804
Yeah.

934
01:13:45,805 --> 01:13:48,403
- How many more?
- Two.

935
01:13:48,474 --> 01:13:50,767
I stranded one in the desert.

936
01:13:50,768 --> 01:13:51,935
And the other?

937
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:53,478
His body's in the hall.

938
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:55,522
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

939
01:13:55,523 --> 01:13:57,232
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

940
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:58,900
The London Sanctum has fallen.

941
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,403
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

942
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:04,197
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

943
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:07,284
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

944
01:14:07,285 --> 01:14:09,286
With its master gone, it needs another.

945
01:14:09,287 --> 01:14:11,509
Master Strange.

946
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:15,384
No.

947
01:14:15,793 --> 01:14:17,878
It is Doctor Strange.

948
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:20,672
Not Master Strange.
Not Mister Strange.

949
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:22,645
Doctor Strange.

950
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:26,803
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

951
01:14:26,804 --> 01:14:28,221
And I have just killed a man!

952
01:14:28,222 --> 01:14:30,140
I'm not doing that again.

953
01:14:30,141 --> 01:14:32,851
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

954
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:36,104
You became a doctor
to save one life above all others.

955
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:37,906
Your own.

956
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:40,567
Still seeing through me, are you?

957
01:14:40,568 --> 01:14:44,738
Your over-inflated ego.

958
01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:48,074
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

959
01:14:48,075 --> 01:14:49,618
even death...

960
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,369
which no one can control.

961
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:54,289
Not even the great
Doctor Stephen Strange.

962
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,184
Not even Dormammu?

963
01:14:58,044 --> 01:15:00,045
He offers immortality.

964
01:15:00,046 --> 01:15:02,339
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

965
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,507
He feeds off it.

966
01:15:03,508 --> 01:15:05,926
Like you feed off him?

967
01:15:05,927 --> 01:15:07,844
You talk to me about controlling death?

968
01:15:07,845 --> 01:15:09,012
Oh, I know how you do it.

969
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:12,612
<i>I've seen the missing rituals
from The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

970
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:15,977
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

971
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,021
Because you might not like them?

972
01:15:18,022 --> 01:15:21,066
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

973
01:15:21,067 --> 01:15:22,734
What is he talking about?

974
01:15:22,735 --> 01:15:26,835
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

975
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,699
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension

976
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,877
to stay alive.

977
01:15:33,037 --> 01:15:34,412
That's not true.

978
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:37,341
I've seen the rituals.
Worked them out.

979
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:39,635
I know how you do it.

980
01:15:40,545 --> 01:15:42,212
Once they regroup...

981
01:15:42,213 --> 01:15:44,422
the Zealots will be back.

982
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:47,066
You'll need reinforcements.

983
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:55,433
She's not who you think she is.

984
01:15:55,434 --> 01:15:57,519
You don't have the right to say that.

985
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,188
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

986
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,524
No, and I don't want to know.

987
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:03,942
You're a coward.

988
01:16:03,943 --> 01:16:05,235
Because I'm not a killer?

989
01:16:05,236 --> 01:16:06,820
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

990
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:09,614
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

991
01:16:09,615 --> 01:16:11,116
What do you think I just did?

992
01:16:11,117 --> 01:16:13,134
You saved your own life!

993
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:16,454
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

994
01:16:16,455 --> 01:16:17,956
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

995
01:16:17,957 --> 01:16:21,431
You've no idea the things I've done.

996
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:24,754
<i>And the answer is yes.</i>

997
01:16:24,755 --> 01:16:26,715
Without hesitation.

998
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:28,008
Even if there's another way?

999
01:16:28,009 --> 01:16:29,968
There is no other way.

1000
01:16:29,969 --> 01:16:31,344
You lack imagination.

1001
01:16:31,345 --> 01:16:32,721
No, Stephen.

1002
01:16:32,722 --> 01:16:36,947
You lack a spine.

1003
01:16:41,272 --> 01:16:43,289
They're back.

1004
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:50,780
We have to end this.

1005
01:16:50,781 --> 01:16:52,673
NOW!

1006
01:16:57,163 --> 01:16:58,455
Strange!

1007
01:16:58,456 --> 01:17:00,373
Get down here and fight!

1008
01:17:00,374 --> 01:17:02,266
No!

1009
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,797
The Mirror Dimension.

1010
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:10,675
You can't affect the real world in here.

1011
01:17:10,676 --> 01:17:12,177
Who's laughing now?

1012
01:17:12,178 --> 01:17:14,104
Asshole.

1013
01:17:15,181 --> 01:17:17,028
I am.

1014
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:31,571
I've got his sling ring.

1015
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:33,373
They can't escape, right?

1016
01:17:33,991 --> 01:17:35,883
Run!

1017
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,969
Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

1018
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,971
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

1019
01:17:55,972 --> 01:17:58,390
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

1020
01:17:58,391 --> 01:18:02,035
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1021
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:20,846
That is hilarious.

1022
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:08,806
This was a mistake.

1023
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,692
Whoa.

1024
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,241
Oh!

1025
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:42,395
It's true.

1026
01:20:42,513 --> 01:20:46,692
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

1027
01:20:49,395 --> 01:20:51,242
Kaecilius.

1028
01:20:53,357 --> 01:20:56,401
I came to you broken...

1029
01:20:56,402 --> 01:20:59,320
lost, in need.

1030
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:02,574
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

1031
01:21:02,575 --> 01:21:04,284
I tried to protect you.

1032
01:21:04,285 --> 01:21:06,786
- From the truth?
- From yourself.

1033
01:21:06,787 --> 01:21:09,247
I have a new teacher now.

1034
01:21:09,248 --> 01:21:11,220
Dormammu deceives you.

1035
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:13,918
You have no idea what he truly is.

1036
01:21:13,919 --> 01:21:17,922
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

1037
01:21:17,923 --> 01:21:19,940
Liar.

1038
01:22:15,065 --> 01:22:16,957
Christine!

1039
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:19,204
Are you kidding me?

1040
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:21,853
Oh, my God.

1041
01:22:23,113 --> 01:22:25,406
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

1042
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,407
- Neurogenic?
- Yes.

1043
01:22:31,622 --> 01:22:33,639
Someone get the swabs.

1044
01:22:35,334 --> 01:22:37,135
Nic?

1045
01:22:39,672 --> 01:22:42,232
We need to relieve
the pressure on her brain.

1046
01:22:44,009 --> 01:22:46,261
She's still dropping.

1047
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:47,387
We're losing her!

1048
01:22:47,388 --> 01:22:48,846
We need to increase her oxygen!

1049
01:22:48,847 --> 01:22:49,889
I need a crash cart!

1050
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,683
Her pupils have dilated!

1051
01:22:51,684 --> 01:22:52,767
No reflexes.

1052
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:55,048
We're not reading any brain activity.

1053
01:23:05,864 --> 01:23:08,132
What are you doing'?

1054
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:10,836
Come on, you're dying!

1055
01:23:18,669 --> 01:23:21,337
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1056
01:23:21,338 --> 01:23:23,089
Time is relative.

1057
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:26,188
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1058
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:29,178
I've spent so many years...

1059
01:23:29,179 --> 01:23:31,055
peering through time...

1060
01:23:31,056 --> 01:23:33,641
looking at this exact moment.

1061
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:35,935
But I can't see past it.

1062
01:23:35,936 --> 01:23:39,564
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

1063
01:23:39,565 --> 01:23:42,233
And after each one,
there's always another.

1064
01:23:42,234 --> 01:23:44,694
And they all lead here...

1065
01:23:44,695 --> 01:23:45,945
but never further.

1066
01:23:45,946 --> 01:23:48,714
You think this is where you die.

1067
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:51,284
You wonder what I see in your future?

1068
01:23:51,285 --> 01:23:53,211
No.

1069
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,872
Yes.

1070
01:23:55,873 --> 01:23:57,707
I never saw your future.

1071
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,126
Only its possibilities.

1072
01:24:00,127 --> 01:24:03,046
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1073
01:24:03,047 --> 01:24:05,006
You always excelled...

1074
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:07,592
but not because you craved success...

1075
01:24:07,593 --> 01:24:10,136
but because of your fear of failure.

1076
01:24:10,137 --> 01:24:12,096
That's what made me a great doctor.

1077
01:24:12,097 --> 01:24:15,491
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1078
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:17,935
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1079
01:24:17,936 --> 01:24:19,395
from learning the simplest

1080
01:24:19,396 --> 01:24:21,522
and most significant lesson of all.

1081
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:23,324
Which is?

1082
01:24:24,777 --> 01:24:27,796
It's not about you.

1083
01:24:30,783 --> 01:24:32,158
When you first came to me...

1084
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:36,133
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1085
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,427
I didn't.

1086
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:43,961
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1087
01:24:43,962 --> 01:24:45,797
He uses magic to walk?

1088
01:24:45,798 --> 01:24:47,548
Constantly.

1089
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:50,176
He had a choice...

1090
01:24:50,177 --> 01:24:52,720
to return to his own life...

1091
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,098
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1092
01:24:55,099 --> 01:24:57,850
So I could have my hands back again?

1093
01:24:57,851 --> 01:24:59,936
My Old life?

1094
01:24:59,937 --> 01:25:01,989
You could.

1095
01:25:02,272 --> 01:25:05,871
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1096
01:25:06,652 --> 01:25:10,029
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1097
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:11,280
But as you well know...

1098
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:13,741
sometimes one must break the rules...

1099
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:15,785
in order to serve the greater good.

1100
01:25:15,786 --> 01:25:17,787
Mordo won't see it that way.

1101
01:25:17,788 --> 01:25:20,498
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1102
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:22,959
forged by the fires of his youth.

1103
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,794
He needs your flexibility...

1104
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:27,643
just <i>as</i> you need his strength.

1105
01:25:27,965 --> 01:25:31,884
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1106
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:34,153
I'm not ready.

1107
01:25:35,431 --> 01:25:37,653
No one ever is.

1108
01:25:38,517 --> 01:25:41,490
We don't get to choose our time.

1109
01:25:44,815 --> 01:25:47,834
Death is what gives life meaning.

1110
01:25:48,152 --> 01:25:50,820
To know your days are numbered.

1111
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:53,669
Your time is short.

1112
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:57,923
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

1113
01:25:58,078 --> 01:25:59,871
But look at me.

1114
01:25:59,872 --> 01:26:03,124
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

1115
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,269
just so that I can watch the snow.

1116
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:46,430
Are you okay?

1117
01:26:53,425 --> 01:26:55,718
I don't understand what's happening.

1118
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:57,595
I know.

1119
01:26:57,596 --> 01:27:01,275
But I have to go away now.

1120
01:27:05,395 --> 01:27:08,356
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1121
01:27:08,357 --> 01:27:10,233
That it could be a beginning.

1122
01:27:10,234 --> 01:27:12,081
Yeah.

1123
01:27:12,778 --> 01:27:16,297
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

1124
01:27:18,617 --> 01:27:20,919
A harder way.

1125
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:24,705
A weirder way.

1126
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:26,707
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.</i>

1127
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,135
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER.</i>

1128
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:35,274
I don't want you to go.

1129
01:28:22,556 --> 01:28:24,528
Stop!

1130
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:56,431
Choose your weapon wisely.

1131
01:28:58,967 --> 01:29:01,940
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1132
01:29:03,388 --> 01:29:05,235
No one.

1133
01:29:20,364 --> 01:29:22,073
Kaecilius.

1134
01:29:22,074 --> 01:29:25,047
You're on the wrong side
of history, Wong.

1135
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:38,547
She's dead.

1136
01:29:38,548 --> 01:29:40,565
You were right.

1137
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:43,811
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1138
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:46,731
She was complicated.

1139
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:52,741
Complicated?

1140
01:29:55,232 --> 01:29:57,775
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1141
01:29:57,776 --> 01:29:59,735
Dangerous.

1142
01:29:59,736 --> 01:30:01,788
What if it overtook her?

1143
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:06,050
She taught us it was forbidden...

1144
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:10,121
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1145
01:30:10,122 --> 01:30:12,039
She did what she thought was right.

1146
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,558
The bill comes due.

1147
01:30:14,668 --> 01:30:16,890
Don't you see?

1148
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:21,132
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1149
01:30:21,133 --> 01:30:25,386
Kaecilius was her fault!

1150
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:26,595
And here we are...

1151
01:30:26,596 --> 01:30:29,649
in the consequence of her deception.

1152
01:30:32,269 --> 01:30:33,811
A world on fire.

1153
01:30:33,812 --> 01:30:36,188
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1154
01:30:36,189 --> 01:30:38,149
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

1155
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:40,192
You know where they're going next.

1156
01:30:40,193 --> 01:30:41,485
Hong Kong.

1157
01:30:41,486 --> 01:30:43,738
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

1158
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:44,947
because one day, it might.

1159
01:30:44,948 --> 01:30:47,283
Well, today is that day.

1160
01:30:47,284 --> 01:30:50,507
I cannot defeat them alone.

1161
01:31:07,095 --> 01:31:09,317
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1162
01:31:16,396 --> 01:31:19,119
The Dark Dimension.

1163
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:22,372
Dormammu is coming.

1164
01:31:24,154 --> 01:31:25,696
It's too late.

1165
01:31:25,697 --> 01:31:27,794
Nothing can stop him.

1166
01:31:29,326 --> 01:31:31,423
Not necessarily.

1167
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,841
No.

1168
01:32:17,415 --> 01:32:19,512
The spell's working.

1169
01:32:20,335 --> 01:32:23,263
We've got a second chance.

1170
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:33,029
Whoa!

1171
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,870
No!

1172
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:15,500
Wong.

1173
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:25,724
Breaking the laws of nature.
I know.

1174
01:34:27,003 --> 01:34:29,225
Well, don't stop now.

1175
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:31,548
When the Sanctum's restored,

1176
01:34:31,549 --> 01:34:32,800
they'll attack it again.

1177
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:34,218
We've got to defend it.

1178
01:34:34,219 --> 01:34:36,271
Come on!

1179
01:35:03,748 --> 01:35:05,040
Get up, Strange.

1180
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:06,750
Get up and fight.

1181
01:35:06,751 --> 01:35:08,928
We can finish this.

1182
01:35:09,462 --> 01:35:12,230
You can't fight the inevitable.

1183
01:35:14,718 --> 01:35:17,395
Isn't it beautiful?

1184
01:35:18,096 --> 01:35:21,319
A world beyond time.

1185
01:35:23,018 --> 01:35:25,240
Beyond death.

1186
01:35:28,606 --> 01:35:31,909
- Beyond time...
- Strange.

1187
01:36:04,059 --> 01:36:06,111
He's gone.

1188
01:36:06,686 --> 01:36:10,786
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

1189
01:36:41,846 --> 01:36:45,432
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1190
01:36:45,433 --> 01:36:48,018
You've come to die.

1191
01:36:48,019 --> 01:36:52,397
Your world is now my world...

1192
01:36:52,398 --> 01:36:55,667
like all worlds.

1193
01:37:24,722 --> 01:37:28,475
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1194
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:31,228
You've come to die.

1195
01:37:31,229 --> 01:37:35,033
Your world is now my...

1196
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,568
What is this?

1197
01:37:37,569 --> 01:37:39,069
Illusion?

1198
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:40,654
No.
This is real.

1199
01:37:40,655 --> 01:37:42,798
Good.

1200
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:55,544
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1201
01:37:55,545 --> 01:37:59,381
You've...
What is happening?

1202
01:37:59,382 --> 01:38:02,259
Just <i>as</i> you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

1203
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:05,137
I brought a little power from mine.

1204
01:38:05,138 --> 01:38:07,764
This is time.

1205
01:38:07,765 --> 01:38:11,435
Endless looped time.

1206
01:38:11,436 --> 01:38:13,812
You dare!

1207
01:38:13,813 --> 01:38:15,614
Oh...

1208
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:20,235
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1209
01:38:20,236 --> 01:38:22,905
You cannot do this forever.

1210
01:38:22,906 --> 01:38:24,781
Actually, I can.

1211
01:38:24,782 --> 01:38:27,159
This is how things are now.

1212
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:30,370
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1213
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:31,747
endlessly.

1214
01:38:31,748 --> 01:38:35,626
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1215
01:38:35,627 --> 01:38:39,755
Yes.
But everyone on Earth will live.

1216
01:38:39,756 --> 01:38:41,548
But you will suffer.

1217
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:44,272
Pain's an old friend.

1218
01:38:45,845 --> 01:38:47,721
Dormammu...

1219
01:38:47,722 --> 01:38:48,972
I've come to bargain.

1220
01:38:48,973 --> 01:38:50,474
End this!

1221
01:38:50,475 --> 01:38:53,653
Dormammu... Dormammu...
Dormammu...

1222
01:39:09,077 --> 01:39:12,881
You will never win.

1223
01:39:13,373 --> 01:39:15,207
No...

1224
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:17,476
but I can lose...

1225
01:39:17,627 --> 01:39:20,837
again and again...

1226
01:39:20,838 --> 01:39:22,673
and again...

1227
01:39:22,674 --> 01:39:25,476
and again, forever.

1228
01:39:26,177 --> 01:39:27,844
And that makes you my prisoner.

1229
01:39:27,845 --> 01:39:29,179
No!

1230
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:30,973
Stop!

1231
01:39:30,974 --> 01:39:33,684
Make this stop!

1232
01:39:33,685 --> 01:39:36,487
Set me free!

1233
01:39:36,688 --> 01:39:38,313
No.

1234
01:39:38,314 --> 01:39:40,957
I've come to bargain.

1235
01:39:41,818 --> 01:39:44,996
What do you want?

1236
01:39:45,989 --> 01:39:48,699
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1237
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:51,326
End your assault on my world.

1238
01:39:51,327 --> 01:39:53,203
Never come back.

1239
01:39:53,204 --> 01:39:54,913
Do it...

1240
01:39:54,914 --> 01:39:57,887
and I'll break the loop.

1241
01:40:06,676 --> 01:40:08,010
Get up, Strange!

1242
01:40:08,011 --> 01:40:09,761
Get up and fight.

1243
01:40:09,762 --> 01:40:11,888
We can finish this.

1244
01:40:11,889 --> 01:40:13,889
Isn't it beautiful?

1245
01:40:15,393 --> 01:40:18,537
A world beyond time.

1246
01:40:20,356 --> 01:40:22,703
Beyond death.

1247
01:40:33,745 --> 01:40:35,245
What have you done?

1248
01:40:35,246 --> 01:40:37,593
I made a bargain.

1249
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:41,552
What is this?

1250
01:40:41,836 --> 01:40:45,480
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1251
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:48,730
Eternal life as part of the One.

1252
01:40:50,553 --> 01:40:53,105
You're not gonna like it.

1253
01:41:12,283 --> 01:41:13,617
Yeah, you know, you really should have

1254
01:41:13,618 --> 01:41:16,620
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

1255
01:41:16,621 --> 01:41:19,674
The warnings come after the spells.

1256
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:30,771
Oh, that's funny.

1257
01:41:57,578 --> 01:41:59,630
We did it.

1258
01:42:01,666 --> 01:42:03,625
Yes.

1259
01:42:03,626 --> 01:42:06,144
Yes, we did it.

1260
01:42:06,337 --> 01:42:08,004
By also violating...

1261
01:42:08,005 --> 01:42:10,307
the natural law.

1262
01:42:10,341 --> 01:42:13,260
Look around you.
It's over.

1263
01:42:13,261 --> 01:42:16,780
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1264
01:42:17,432 --> 01:42:19,683
No price to pay?

1265
01:42:19,684 --> 01:42:23,488
We broke our rules, just like her.

1266
01:42:23,688 --> 01:42:27,858
The bill comes due.

1267
01:42:27,859 --> 01:42:29,751
Always!

1268
01:42:30,194 --> 01:42:32,166
A reckoning.

1269
01:42:34,449 --> 01:42:38,093
I will follow this path no longer.

1270
01:43:11,194 --> 01:43:13,462
Yeah, okay.

1271
01:43:22,038 --> 01:43:24,080
Wise choice.

1272
01:43:24,081 --> 01:43:26,249
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1273
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,585
once you've mastered its powers.

1274
01:43:28,586 --> 01:43:30,558
Until then...

1275
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,590
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1276
01:43:33,591 --> 01:43:35,438
A what?

1277
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:38,178
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1278
01:43:38,179 --> 01:43:40,822
but you still have much to learn.

1279
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:45,227
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1280
01:43:45,228 --> 01:43:48,271
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1281
01:43:48,272 --> 01:43:49,439
We must be ready.

1282
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,241
We'll be ready.

1283
01:46:36,941 --> 01:46:41,086
<i>THOR". So Earth has wizards now, huh?</i>

1284
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:43,905
Tea?

1285
01:46:43,906 --> 01:46:45,365
I don't drink tea.

1286
01:46:45,366 --> 01:46:47,167
What do you drink?

1287
01:46:47,743 --> 01:46:49,886
Not tea.

1288
01:46:52,581 --> 01:46:54,374
So, I keep a watch list...

1289
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,251
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1290
01:46:56,252 --> 01:46:57,794
that may be a threat to this world.

1291
01:46:57,795 --> 01:47:02,190
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1292
01:47:03,801 --> 01:47:05,552
Worthy inclusion.

1293
01:47:05,553 --> 01:47:07,525
Yeah.

1294
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:12,100
So why bring him here to New York?

1295
01:47:12,101 --> 01:47:13,643
It's a bit of a long story.

1296
01:47:13,644 --> 01:47:15,729
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1297
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:17,981
But we're looking for my father.

1298
01:47:17,982 --> 01:47:21,276
Oh, okay.
So if you found Odin...

1299
01:47:21,277 --> 01:47:24,487
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1300
01:47:24,488 --> 01:47:25,989
Oh, yes.
Promptly.

1301
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:28,167
Great!

1302
01:47:28,659 --> 01:47:31,086
Allow me to help you.

1303
01:53:31,522 --> 01:53:33,448
Can I help you?

1304
01:53:33,899 --> 01:53:37,828
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1305
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:41,339
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1306
01:53:41,907 --> 01:53:43,708
Mordo.

1307
01:53:45,744 --> 01:53:47,662
So what can I do for you, man?

1308
01:53:47,663 --> 01:53:49,580
I've been away
for many months now,

1309
01:53:49,581 --> 01:53:52,133
and I've had a revelation.

1310
01:53:52,209 --> 01:53:55,044
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1311
01:53:55,045 --> 01:53:58,473
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1312
01:53:58,590 --> 01:54:00,892
stealing power...

1313
01:54:00,926 --> 01:54:03,094
perverting nature.

1314
01:54:03,095 --> 01:54:05,238
Like you.

1315
01:54:05,389 --> 01:54:08,533
I've stolen nothing.
This is my power.

1316
01:54:08,559 --> 01:54:11,407
- Mine.
- Power...

1317
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:14,197
has a purpose.

1318
01:54:27,452 --> 01:54:29,787
Why are you doing this?

1319
01:54:29,788 --> 01:54:33,762
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1320
01:54:38,255 --> 01:54:41,183
Too many sorcerers.
