1
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,148
Stark!

2
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,661
He doesn't seem happy.

3
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,228
Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,421
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:29,387
I took a detour...

6
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:32,591
Through your defense lab.

7
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:35,541
Tell me that isn't what
I think it is.

8
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:39,661
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:43,021
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

10
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:44,621
You were instructed to go to Russia.

11
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,701
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

12
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:47,901
I'm a scientist.

13
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:49,621
Then act like one.

14
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:52,261
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

15
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:53,461
Help us put it to good use.

16
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:55,941
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

17
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,941
and now you try to steal my research?

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,467
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

19
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,069
Ah...

20
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,151
Easy, Hank.

21
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,021
You mention my wife again

22
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,141
and I'll show you ferocity.

23
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,947
Don't look at me. You said it.

24
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,221
I formally tender my resignation.

25
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:22,621
We don't accept it. Formally.

26
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:23,981
Hank,

27
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,781
we need you.

28
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,181
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

29
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,581
Don't let your past determine the future.

30
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,581
As long as I am alive,

31
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:37,265
nobody will ever get that formula.

32
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,821
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

33
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,101
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

34
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,701
Yes.

35
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,821
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

36
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,941
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

37
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:58,023
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

38
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,181
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

39
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,873
He's no security risk.

40
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,787
Unless we make him one.

41
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,789
You like that?

42
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,141
You like that?

43
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,788
Come get you some now.

44
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:01,549
You didn't even move.

45
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:02,941
Nah.

46
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,261
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

47
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,464
You see this right here?

48
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,661
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

49
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,706
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

50
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,421
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

51
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:24,461
All right, break it up.

52
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,984
Break it up! Break it up!

53
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:45,261
Scotty!

54
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,101
What's up, man!

55
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:48,621
Damn! Hey.

56
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,110
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

57
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,141
Hey, what's up with your eye?

58
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,301
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

59
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,261
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

60
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:01,431
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,501
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

62
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,865
Well, I definitely didn't.

63
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,821
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

64
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,381
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

65
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:12,781
Hey, how's your girl, man?

66
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:14,144
Oh, she left me.

67
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,074
- Oh.
- Yeah, my ma died, too.

68
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,388
And my dad got deported.

69
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:21,901
But I got the van!

70
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:23,628
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

71
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:26,381
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

72
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:28,741
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

73
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,301
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

74
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:31,821
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

75
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,501
And I gotta introduce you to some
people. Some really skilled people.

76
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,221
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

77
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:38,744
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

78
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,181
I got a daughter to take care of.

79
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,461
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

80
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,587
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

81
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,504
I'm gonna be fine.

82
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,021
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

83
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,101
Would you like to try our
Mango Fruit Blast?

84
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,304
Uh, no, thanks.

85
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,701
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

86
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,341
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.

87
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,341
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

88
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,432
It's ice cream.
Baskin-Robbins.

89
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:11,950
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

90
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:13,501
Dude.

91
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,381
Can I see you in the back, chief?
Pronto.

92
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,187
Sure thing, Dale.

93
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,033
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

94
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,992
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on in.

95
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:27,749
Pull up some chair.

96
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:32,301
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

97
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,581
You found out.

98
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,901
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

99
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,470
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I...

100
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,061
No one would hire me.

101
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,581
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

102
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:44,821
Look, I'm sorry.

103
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,381
I don't do it anymore. I just...

104
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,584
Respect.

105
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,741
I couldn't be happier about it.

106
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,261
- Really?
- Yeah.

107
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,261
Thank you. Thank you.

108
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,901
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

109
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,501
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

110
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,101
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

111
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:03,261
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

112
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:05,741
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

113
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:08,101
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

114
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,748
Well, you're fired, of course.

115
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:13,421
I can't really keep you on.

116
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:15,181
Wait, what? Fired?

117
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,341
Yeah.

118
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,461
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

119
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,421
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

120
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,781
I'll tell you what, though.

121
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:26,021
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

122
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:29,101
but if you want to grab one of those
Mango Fruit Blasts

123
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,501
on your way out the door,

124
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,149
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

125
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,034
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

126
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,181
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

127
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,101
I was. I got fired.

128
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,901
Damn. They find out who you are?

129
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,021
Yeah.

130
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:21,821
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

131
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,861
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

132
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:27,181
- You want some waffles?
- Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

133
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,661
Oh. That's Kurt.

134
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:31,183
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

135
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,544
- Nice meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

136
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,470
Who are you?

137
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:37,904
Dave.

138
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,793
Nice work on the Vista job.

139
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:42,901
Vista job, yes.

140
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,461
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

141
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:48,901
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

142
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,701
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

143
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,221
You mean you're a pussy.

144
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:54,381
Yeah.

145
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:56,301
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

146
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:57,821
And it added up to millions.

147
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,912
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

148
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:01,621
And what does he do?

149
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,621
He hacks into the security system

150
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,381
and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

151
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:08,381
Posts all the bank records online.

152
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:10,743
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

153
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:15,101
What are you doing?

154
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:16,350
Hmm?

155
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,301
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

156
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,661
What do you want?

157
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:21,741
Okay.

158
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,221
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

159
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,581
- about this little perfect job.
- No way.

160
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:29,061
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

161
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:30,101
No!

162
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,501
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

163
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,621
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

164
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,661
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

165
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,945
I don't care. I'm out.

166
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:58,901
Dr. Pym?

167
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,504
Yes. I'm still alive.

168
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,630
ID?

169
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:13,151
Perhaps that will suffice.

170
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,385
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

171
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,671
Is that Hank Pym?

172
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,029
Good morning, Hank.

173
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,181
Hope.

174
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:31,863
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

175
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,707
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

176
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:38,191
More like "thrilled."

177
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:42,661
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

178
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:44,141
What's the occasion?

179
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:46,232
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

180
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:52,427
We're ready for you inside.

181
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,624
Ouch.

182
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:59,021
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

183
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:00,907
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

184
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,865
You're in for a treat.

185
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:11,308
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

186
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,547
How's your face?

187
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,352
After you.

188
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:29,021
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

189
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:31,590
This company's founder and my mentor,

190
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:33,264
Dr. Hank Pym.

191
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:50,741
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

192
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,061
I immediately started
researching a particle

193
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,901
that could change
the distance between atoms,

194
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,947
while increasing density and strength.

195
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:02,381
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

196
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:06,741
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

197
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:08,741
But just imagine,

198
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:13,187
a soldier the size of an insect.

199
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,193
The ultimate secret weapon.

200
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:32,185
An Ant-Man.

201
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,511
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

202
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:41,181
Silly, I know.

203
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:42,873
Propaganda.

204
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,032
Tales to astonish!

205
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,341
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

206
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,261
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

207
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,990
every single time I asked you,

208
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:59,941
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

209
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,661
Just a tall tale.

210
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:02,781
Right.

211
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:06,066
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

212
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:19,981
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

213
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:22,901
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

214
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:26,152
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

215
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:28,627
Could that be done?

216
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,434
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

217
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,783
Distinguished guests,

218
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,821
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

219
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,832
The Yellowjacket!

220
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,821
Oh, no.

221
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:53,345
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

222
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,301
capable of altering the size of the wearer

223
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,585
for the ultimate combat advantage.

224
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,541
<i>We live in an era</i>

225
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:02,861
<i>in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves</i>

226
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:06,021
<i>are undermined
by constant surveillance.</i>

227
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:07,952
<i>It's time to return to a simpler age.</i>

228
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,741
<i>One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly</i>

229
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,229
<i>to protect their interests.</i>

230
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:16,021
<i>An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,</i>

231
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,461
<i>The Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict</i>

232
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,901
<i>on the geopolitical landscape</i>

233
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,061
<i>completely unseen.</i>

234
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:26,188
<i>Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.</i>

235
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,381
<i>Practical applications
include surveillance,</i>

236
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,267
<i>industrial sabotage,</i>

237
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,341
<i>and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.</i>

238
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,661
<i>A single Yellowjacket</i>

239
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:41,584
<i>offers the user unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.</i>

240
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,061
<i>And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets</i>

241
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:50,341
<i>will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.</i>

242
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,432
<i>The Yellowjacket.</i>

243
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:54,873
So, it's a suit?

244
00:13:58,301 --> 00:13:59,901
Don't be crude, Frank.

245
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,232
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

246
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,061
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

247
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,021
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

248
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:11,101
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

249
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,741
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

250
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:15,707
I really value your opinion.

251
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,227
Thank you for coming. Hope?

252
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:21,541
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

253
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:22,869
Thank you.

254
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,581
You seem a bit shocked.

255
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:31,941
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

256
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:34,145
So you finally admit it!

257
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:38,430
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

258
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,581
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

259
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,229
Don't do this.

260
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:45,467
Dr. Cross?

261
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:49,341
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

262
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,301
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

263
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,709
Deal.

264
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:03,461
We have to
make our move, Hank.

265
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:04,581
How close is he?

266
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,341
He still can't shrink a live subject.

267
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,981
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

268
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,184
No.

269
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,181
I have Cross' complete trust.

270
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,545
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have a choice.

271
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:18,185
Well, that's not entirely true.

272
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:22,026
I think I found a guy.

273
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,868
Who?

274
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,541
Daddy!

275
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,141
Peanut! Oh!

276
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:34,381
Happy birthday!

277
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:35,461
I'm so sorry I'm late.

278
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,141
I didn't know
what time your party started.

279
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:38,701
It was on the invitation.

280
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,541
He didn't get an invitation.

281
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,141
But he came anyway!

282
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,181
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

283
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,021
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

284
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,101
Oh, you don't...

285
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:49,181
What are you doing here, Lang?

286
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,781
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

287
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,541
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

288
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:53,701
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

289
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:57,225
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

290
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,341
Hey, look what I have for you.

291
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,821
Can I open it now?

292
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,752
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

293
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,581
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

294
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:11,821
What is that thing?

295
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,752
He's so ugly!

296
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:16,181
I love him!

297
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,781
Can I go show my friends?

298
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,906
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

299
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,061
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

300
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,261
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

301
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,341
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

302
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,181
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

303
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:30,781
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
- It's my house!

304
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:32,543
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

305
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,781
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

306
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:36,901
It's a birthday party.

307
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:38,661
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

308
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:39,741
She's my daughter.

309
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:41,221
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

310
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:45,421
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

311
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,421
Your fiancé is an asshat.

312
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:48,581
He's not an asshat.

313
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:51,541
- Hey, watch your language. Okay?
- What language? I said "hat."

314
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:53,108
Stop it.

315
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,301
Really, Maggie? That guy?

316
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:57,981
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

317
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,421
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

318
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,273
At least he's not a crook.

319
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,741
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight.

320
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,310
I had a job and...

321
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:10,781
I wanna provide.

322
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:13,381
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

323
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:14,461
So much.

324
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:17,861
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

325
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:19,064
What do I do?

326
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:21,149
Get an apartment,

327
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,981
get a job, pay child support.

328
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:27,392
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

329
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:29,911
You're her hero, Scott.

330
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:35,073
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

331
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:01,673
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

332
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:04,141
Yeah. Well, uh...

333
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:08,826
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

334
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,107
It'd be nice though, right?

335
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,590
But there are laws.

336
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,581
What laws? Of man?

337
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:18,101
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

338
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,465
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

339
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:26,826
Darren, I don't think you understand...

340
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:30,824
Hmm.

341
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,383
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

342
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,954
Goodbye, Frank.

343
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,107
Thank you.

344
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:03,861
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

345
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,301
And today,
during my morning meditation,

346
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:09,301
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

347
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:10,661
How's that?

348
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:12,672
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

349
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:17,541
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

350
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,221
I devoted my genius to him.

351
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:22,266
I could have worked anywhere.

352
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:24,593
I chose my mentor poorly.

353
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,232
You didn't even have a choice.

354
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,230
He never believed in you.

355
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:35,865
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

356
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:39,267
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

357
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:42,781
Because his failures as a mentor,

358
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,111
as a father,

359
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,786
forced us to spread our wings.

360
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,545
You're a success, Darren.

361
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,704
You deserve everything
coming your way.

362
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:17,821
Ooh.

363
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,673
Stop cheating.

364
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:21,993
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

365
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:25,141
Maybe he didn't hear you.

366
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,344
How was the party?

367
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,541
- Tell me about that tip.
- What?

368
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,581
I wanna know about that tip.

369
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,301
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

370
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,781
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

371
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:44,269
It's gotta be airtight.

372
00:20:44,981 --> 00:20:46,021
Okay.

373
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:48,341
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

374
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,741
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

375
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:53,141
But there was a rosé that saved the day.
It was delightful.

376
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:55,821
<i>And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.</i>

377
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,101
<i>It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.</i>

378
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,821
It's the wrong details.

379
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:01,261
It has nothing to do with the story.

380
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,464
Go.

381
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:06,821
<i>So, uh, he tells me that she's
working as a housekeeper now, right?</i>

382
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:10,221
<i>And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.</i>

383
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,381
<i>And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.</i>

384
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:15,821
<i>Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO</i>

385
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:17,981
<i>That is all retired now, but he's loaded.</i>

386
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:21,821
<i>And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,</i>

387
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,501
<i>and they get to talking, right?</i>

388
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:27,021
<i>And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.</i>

389
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:31,181
<i>"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."</i>

390
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:33,741
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

391
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:34,821
<i>Of course, I ask him...</i>

392
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:38,221
<i>"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"</i>

393
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:39,541
<i>And he says, "Nah, dawg.</i>

394
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:41,821
<i>"All she said is that it's super-legit</i>

395
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:44,185
<i>"and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."</i>

396
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,061
What?

397
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:50,661
Old man have safe.

398
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:52,821
And he's gone for a week.

399
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,861
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

400
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,061
and he's gone for a week.

401
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,221
Let's just work with that.

402
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,868
You know what I'm saying?

403
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,741
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

404
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:53,101
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

405
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:54,181
Comm check.

406
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:55,381
- Check.
- Check.

407
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,661
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

408
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:58,981
Don't worry.

409
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:01,390
It's not gonna happen.

410
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:05,627
I love it when he gets cocky.

411
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:12,744
Damn!

412
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,461
Alarm is dead.

413
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:42,710
Nice.

414
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,344
<i>All right,
I'm moving through the house.</i>

415
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,301
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

416
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,981
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

417
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:19,141
<i>Aw, man, are we screwed?</i>

418
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,266
Not necessarily.

419
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:10,221
I'm in.

420
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:13,632
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

421
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:19,141
Oh, man.

422
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:20,674
<i>What is it?</i>

423
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:23,901
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

424
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:26,221
<i>How serious
are we talking, Scotty?</i>

425
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:27,981
It's a Carbondale.

426
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:29,461
It's from 1910.

427
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,301
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

428
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:33,621
Wow.

429
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,101
Can you crack it?

430
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,621
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

431
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:39,981
Remember what that iceberg did?

432
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:41,781
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

433
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:42,861
Killed everybody.

434
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:44,501
Did not kill the Old lady.

435
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:46,865
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

436
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,501
<i>What are you doing?</i>

437
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,343
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

438
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:46,224
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

439
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,705
<i>- What are you doing now?</i>
- Waiting.

440
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:51,304
Waiting.

441
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:00,544
Nice.

442
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:06,433
<i>What is it? Cash? Jewels?</i>

443
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:09,546
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

444
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:13,072
- It's a suit.
- What?

445
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,592
It's an old motorcycle suit.

446
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:18,381
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

447
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:20,028
No.

448
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:21,741
It's a bust.

449
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,341
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

450
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,307
I know you needed to score.

451
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:02,434
I thought we were using mice.

452
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:04,424
What's the difference?

453
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:10,541
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

454
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:12,421
Darren, maybe we should think...

455
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:14,981
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

456
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:17,185
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

457
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,821
Experiment 34-C results,

458
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,070
negative.

459
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:55,024
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

460
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:07,833
Why would you lock this up?

461
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,784
This is so weird.

462
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:05,154
Scotty, what's up, man?

463
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:12,790
I wonder... What is this?

464
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,581
<i>The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?</i>

465
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:49,184
What? Who said that?

466
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:56,512
Luis, down here!

467
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:00,821
<i>It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,</i>

468
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:02,070
<i>water.</i>

469
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,830
<i>Guess you're tougher
than you thought.</i>

470
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:32,988
Oh, I don't want to see this!

471
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:34,903
Luis!

472
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:40,870
Son of a...

473
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:59,394
What the hell?

474
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,821
<i>Not bad for a test drive.</i>

475
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:05,021
<i>Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.</i>

476
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:07,271
No! No! No, thank you!

477
00:33:19,421 --> 00:33:21,421
Get down on the ground!

478
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,901
You are under arrest!

479
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,781
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

480
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:26,984
Oh...

481
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,953
Don't move.

482
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:36,101
<i>You know,
you almost had us convinced</i>

483
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:38,431
that you were gonna change your ways.

484
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:41,145
They were really rooting for you.

485
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,785
It's gonna break their hearts.

486
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,944
- You got a visitor.
- Who?

487
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:51,384
Your lawyer.

488
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:53,514
My lawyer?

489
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:59,069
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

490
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:03,549
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

491
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:05,384
Oh, man.

492
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:07,069
Sit down.

493
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:13,621
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

494
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,581
I don't even wanna know
why you have it.

495
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:17,751
Maggie was right about you.

496
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,221
How do you know about...

497
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:22,463
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

498
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:25,301
The moment things get hard,

499
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,948
you turn right back to crime.

500
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:31,501
The way I see it,
you have a choice.

501
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:34,354
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

502
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:37,026
or go back to your cell

503
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,981
and await further instructions.

504
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:41,461
I don't understand.

505
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:43,701
No, I don't expect you to.

506
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:46,821
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

507
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:48,354
neither do I.

508
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,981
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

509
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:54,344
What?

510
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,701
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

511
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:10,821
So, next time you think
you might see one,

512
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:15,506
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

513
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,621
<i>You're my bestest friend!</i>

514
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:31,701
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

515
00:35:31,901 --> 00:35:33,826
No, I love this one.

516
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:37,154
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

517
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:39,061
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

518
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,584
Is Daddy a bad man?

519
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,027
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

520
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:47,109
No.

521
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:51,032
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

522
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:45,467
<i>Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.</i>

523
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,504
<i>Under the door.</i>

524
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:54,101
Okay, where to now?

525
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:56,305
<i>- Hang tight.</i>
- Oh, God.

526
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:00,021
What, what?

527
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:01,101
Where the hell did he go?

528
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:02,461
I have no idea.
He just vanished.

529
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:04,501
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

530
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:05,781
Get back! Get back!

531
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:08,589
<i>Scott, these are my associates.</i>

532
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,381
Is that a camera on an ant?

533
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,341
Yeah, sure. Why not?

534
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,421
Where's the car?

535
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,141
<i>No car. We've got wings.</i>

536
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:16,629
<i>Incoming!</i>

537
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:29,461
<i>Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.</i>

538
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:31,663
- How safe is...
<i>- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!</i>

539
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:48,181
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

540
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:50,661
<i>So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.</i>

541
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:52,381
All right.

542
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:54,421
- Now, what's the next move?
<i>- Hang on tight.</i>

543
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,261
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

544
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:57,981
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

545
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:00,101
<i>You're throwing 247 off balance.</i>

546
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,581
Wait, his name is 247?

547
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,421
<i>He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.</i>

548
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:06,061
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?</i>

549
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:07,861
Whoa!

550
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:09,821
<i>Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.</i>

551
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,341
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

552
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,545
<i>- No, I think it's 247.</i>
- Wait.

553
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,341
<i>Hang on tight!</i>

554
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,421
I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

555
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:20,381
<i>I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.</i>

556
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,421
What?

557
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:23,512
- Can I make one little request?
<i>- No.</i>

558
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:26,906
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

559
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:28,741
Time out.

560
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:29,901
All right, hold on.

561
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,992
Just wait! Whoa!

562
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,101
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

563
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:37,541
<i>It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.</i>

564
00:38:37,741 --> 00:38:39,221
Let's set her down, all right?

565
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:40,301
I'm getting light-headed.

566
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:41,584
<i>Hang on, Scott.</i>

567
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:44,101
I'm getting a little light...

568
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:46,226
I need a snooze button.

569
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,110
Hit me in 5 minutes.

570
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:08,943
Hello.

571
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:13,544
Who are you?

572
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:18,261
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

573
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:19,421
Yes.

574
00:39:19,621 --> 00:39:20,784
Why?

575
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:23,783
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

576
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,786
Oh. Oh.

577
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:28,624
Hey, look...

578
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:30,544
Whoa!

579
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:36,781
<i>Paraponera clavata.</i>

580
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:38,341
Giant tropical bullet ants,

581
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:39,981
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

582
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:42,063
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

583
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,948
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

584
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,544
Who?

585
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:50,781
Hey!

586
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:53,668
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

587
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:01,986
How am I supposed to do this?

588
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:11,306
All right, just one step at a time.

589
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:14,424
Ugh!

590
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:20,586
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

591
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,581
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

592
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:27,861
We don't need this guy.

593
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:30,421
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

594
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:33,061
I did. She's great.

595
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:35,381
She doesn't think that we need you.

596
00:40:35,581 --> 00:40:36,821
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

597
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:40,141
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

598
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:42,781
and then Hope has you arrested.

599
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:45,901
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

600
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:47,707
She's a little bit anxious.

601
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:49,581
It has to do with this job,

602
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,181
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

603
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,501
I take it that you're interested in.

604
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:55,701
What job?

605
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,064
Would you like some tea?

606
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,181
Uh... Sure.

607
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:00,861
I was very impressed with

608
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:03,873
how you managed to get
past my security system.

609
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:07,981
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

610
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:09,501
Were you watching me?

611
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,781
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

612
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:15,384
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

613
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:18,501
Oh! Excuse me.

614
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,671
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

615
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:26,141
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

616
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:27,941
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

617
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:29,941
But you beat it.

618
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:31,341
Would you like some sugar?

619
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,113
Yeah, thanks.

620
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:38,263
You know what?
I'm okay.

621
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:45,261
How do you make them do that?

622
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,981
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

623
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:51,701
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

624
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:54,065
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

625
00:41:56,021 --> 00:42:01,632
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

626
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,581
I speak to them.

627
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:07,061
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

628
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:08,541
and see everything.

629
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:10,632
And still know absolutely nothing.

630
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:12,270
I'm late to meet Cross.

631
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,741
Uh... Dr. Pym?

632
00:42:17,941 --> 00:42:20,264
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

633
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:23,341
Sorry, I just have one question.

634
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,541
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

635
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:27,261
and can I go back to jail now?

636
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,874
Come with me.

637
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:33,501
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

638
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:34,781
Huh?

639
00:42:34,981 --> 00:42:37,101
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

640
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,901
That's what powers the suit.

641
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:40,787
That's why it works.

642
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:42,984
Wow.

643
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:49,987
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

644
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:52,745
It was too dangerous.

645
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:55,951
So I hid it from the world.

646
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:59,753
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

647
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,661
Pym Tech.

648
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:02,989
Yes.

649
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:07,621
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

650
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:08,941
Darren Cross.

651
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:10,061
He's a big deal.

652
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,621
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

653
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:17,021
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

654
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:19,421
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

655
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:23,101
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

656
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,821
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

657
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,232
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

658
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:31,661
But I wouldn't help him.

659
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:35,581
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

660
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,181
How could he do that?

661
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,061
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

662
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:41,594
She was the deciding vote.

663
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:45,061
But she came back to me

664
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:48,631
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

665
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:51,821
The process is highly volatile.

666
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:54,741
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

667
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:57,833
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

668
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:00,741
I don't think Darren realizes this,

669
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:03,787
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

670
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:06,625
So, what do you want from me?

671
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:12,261
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

672
00:44:12,461 --> 00:44:13,341
Do you?

673
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:14,988
I do.

674
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:17,021
If you can help me,

675
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,944
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

676
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:24,350
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

677
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:25,901
Absolutely.

678
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:29,869
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

679
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:32,181
What do you want me to do?

680
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:35,785
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

681
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:40,263
Are you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

682
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:44,381
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up.
Text me.

683
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:45,869
Okay. Good news?

684
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:48,261
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

685
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:50,989
Are you trying to find my daddy?

686
00:44:52,821 --> 00:44:54,632
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

687
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,221
I just want your daddy to be safe.

688
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,551
Hope you don't catch him.

689
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,221
This isn't the first time these guys

690
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:50,101
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

691
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:54,221
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

692
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,790
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

693
00:45:57,341 --> 00:45:59,101
He always wanted my tech.

694
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:02,501
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

695
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:04,831
and destroy all the data,

696
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:10,873
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

697
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:17,348
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

698
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:20,301
I spent half my life

699
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:23,541
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

700
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:27,381
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

701
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:30,861
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

702
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:33,589
This could change the texture of reality.

703
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:39,593
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

704
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:42,146
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

705
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:44,821
Scott, they are ants.

706
00:46:45,021 --> 00:46:48,948
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

707
00:46:50,021 --> 00:46:54,741
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

708
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:58,421
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

709
00:46:58,621 --> 00:47:00,581
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

710
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:03,389
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

711
00:47:03,941 --> 00:47:05,381
I was against using him
when we had months,

712
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:07,421
and now we have days.

713
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:08,501
I'm wearing the suit.

714
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:09,981
Absolutely not!

715
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:12,981
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

716
00:47:13,181 --> 00:47:14,621
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

717
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:17,381
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

718
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:19,901
- We don't have time to screw around!
- Hope, please listen to me...

719
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:21,541
He is a criminal!
I'm your daughter.

720
00:47:21,741 --> 00:47:23,074
No!

721
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,101
She's right, Hank.

722
00:48:03,301 --> 00:48:04,987
I'm not your guy.

723
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:07,781
Why don't you wear the suit?

724
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:10,061
You think I don't want to?

725
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:11,503
I can't.

726
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,986
I spent years wearing it,

727
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:17,830
and it took a toll on me.

728
00:48:25,221 --> 00:48:26,554
You're our only option.

729
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,741
Before Hope lost her mother,

730
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:38,868
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

731
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:44,031
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

732
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,345
It's too late for me,

733
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:52,221
but not for you.

734
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:54,221
This is your chance.

735
00:48:54,421 --> 00:48:57,901
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

736
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,994
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

737
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:05,229
It's not about saving our world.

738
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:08,913
It's about saving theirs.

739
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:13,706
Damn. That was a good speech.

740
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:15,384
Scott,

741
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:20,223
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

742
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:24,541
In the right hands,

743
00:49:24,741 --> 00:49:27,901
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

744
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:31,741
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

745
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:34,661
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

746
00:49:34,861 --> 00:49:35,941
you need to be fast.

747
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,941
You should be able to shrink and grow

748
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,349
on a dime.

749
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:43,265
So your size always suits your needs.

750
00:49:44,301 --> 00:49:46,061
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

751
00:49:46,261 --> 00:49:50,234
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

752
00:49:52,101 --> 00:49:53,628
Ow!

753
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:55,944
Ahhh!

754
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:57,941
Ow!

755
00:49:58,141 --> 00:49:59,269
Useless.

756
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,901
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

757
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:04,901
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

758
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:08,261
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

759
00:50:08,461 --> 00:50:11,701
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

760
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:13,261
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

761
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:15,101
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

762
00:50:15,301 --> 00:50:16,901
Show me.

763
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:18,863
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

764
00:50:19,461 --> 00:50:20,464
Show me...

765
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:23,541
That's how you punch.

766
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:26,381
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

767
00:50:26,581 --> 00:50:29,101
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

768
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:31,261
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

769
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,381
We lost her in a plane crash.

770
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:35,181
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

771
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:36,821
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

772
00:50:37,021 --> 00:50:38,787
We're working, here.

773
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:43,703
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

774
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,704
Were you going for the hand?

775
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:55,021
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

776
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:57,781
Do not screw with the regulator.

777
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:59,621
If that regulator is compromised,

778
00:50:59,821 --> 00:51:01,261
you would go subatomic.

779
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,828
What does that mean?

780
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:05,981
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

781
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:07,461
What does that mean?

782
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:12,061
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

783
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:13,181
become irrelevant

784
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:16,227
as you shrink for all eternity.

785
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:19,421
Everything that you know

786
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:20,954
and love,

787
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,433
gone forever.

788
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:27,541
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

789
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:28,941
You've learned about the suit,

790
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:31,874
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

791
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:34,230
the ants.

792
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:35,981
Loyal, brave,

793
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:37,992
<i>and your partners on this job.</i>

794
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,821
Paratrechina longicornis.
<i>Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

795
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,101
<i>They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,</i>

796
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:51,621
<i>which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.</i>

797
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:53,507
You're not so crazy.

798
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:55,821
Hey!

799
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:57,309
You're cute.

800
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:07,911
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

801
00:52:17,261 --> 00:52:20,821
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

802
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:22,821
<i>There's a security guard posted
around the clock.</i>

803
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:25,501
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

804
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:28,274
Okay, who's next?

805
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:31,501
Paraponera clavata.

806
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:33,221
<i>I know. Bullet ants, right?</i>

807
00:52:33,421 --> 00:52:34,901
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

808
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:36,912
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

809
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,501
<i>The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,</i>

810
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:42,901
And the only access point is a tube

811
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:45,741
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

812
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:47,661
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

813
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:49,941
<i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

814
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:51,781
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

815
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:54,461
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

816
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:58,621
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

817
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:00,985
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

818
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:03,101
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

819
00:53:03,301 --> 00:53:05,981
Ideal for ground and air transport.

820
00:53:06,181 --> 00:53:07,867
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

821
00:53:09,141 --> 00:53:11,341
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

822
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:12,661
That's good. That's very good.

823
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:17,381
Because this time, you're really gonna
have to learn how to control him.

824
00:53:17,581 --> 00:53:20,314
<i>Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.</i>

825
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:24,549
Aw! You okay?
Did I hurt...

826
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,341
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

827
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:40,781
<i>The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.</i>

828
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:42,223
<i>Red shrinks.</i>

829
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,833
<i>Blue enlarges.</i>

830
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:49,221
Solenopsis mandibularis.

831
00:53:49,421 --> 00:53:50,621
<i>Known for their bite,</i>

832
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:53,421
<i>the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.</i>

833
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:56,706
<i>They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.</i>

834
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:08,027
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

835
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:12,621
They're not listening to me.

836
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:15,341
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

837
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,461
No shortcuts, no lies.

838
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:22,141
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

839
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:23,741
We don't have time for coddling.

840
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:25,981
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

841
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,594
Really?

842
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:30,347
Is that where our focus should be?

843
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:55,829
Hope!

844
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:07,354
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

845
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:18,470
We can't do this without her.

846
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:23,581
Oh, God.

847
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:25,621
You gotta lock your doors.

848
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:28,581
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

849
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:30,467
Do you think this is a joke?

850
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:33,901
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

851
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:35,221
You have a daughter.

852
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:36,621
I'm doing this for her.

853
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:39,793
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

854
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:41,421
He was in grief.

855
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:42,861
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

856
00:55:43,061 --> 00:55:45,669
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

857
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:48,466
He just sent me off to boarding school.

858
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:50,784
You know, I thought,

859
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:52,861
with all that's at stake,

860
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:56,101
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

861
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:58,101
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

862
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:01,061
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

863
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:02,501
Then why are you here?

864
00:56:02,701 --> 00:56:04,705
It proves that he loves you.

865
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:08,390
Hope. Look at me.

866
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:11,313
I'm expendable.

867
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:13,388
That's why I'm here.

868
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:16,386
You must have realized that by now.

869
00:56:17,261 --> 00:56:19,470
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

870
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:23,710
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

871
00:56:25,621 --> 00:56:26,670
Anyway...

872
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:31,021
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

873
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,464
when I called the cops on you.

874
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:38,664
What's her name?

875
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:40,993
Cassie.

876
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:43,507
It's a pretty name.

877
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:49,621
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

878
00:56:49,821 --> 00:56:51,791
That's how it works.

879
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:54,221
Think about Cassie.

880
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:58,348
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

881
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:08,741
Open your eyes

882
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:11,310
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

883
00:57:34,141 --> 00:57:35,383
That's good!

884
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,021
Your mother convinced me

885
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:59,306
to let her join me on my missions.

886
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:01,861
They called her the Wasp.

887
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,304
She was born to it.

888
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,911
And there's not a day that goes by

889
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:11,787
that I don't regret having said yes.

890
00:58:16,261 --> 00:58:17,947
It was 1987.

891
00:58:18,741 --> 00:58:23,226
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

892
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:27,753
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

893
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:38,221
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

894
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:40,346
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

895
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:54,221
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

896
00:58:54,421 --> 00:58:57,666
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

897
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:00,701
<i>Your mother,</i>

898
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:02,268
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

899
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:06,027
Janet! No!

900
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:15,263
She turned off her regulator

901
00:59:16,021 --> 00:59:17,752
and went subatomic

902
00:59:19,221 --> 00:59:21,351
to deactivate the bomb.

903
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:24,952
And she was gone.

904
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:31,511
Your mom died a hero.

905
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:36,421
And I spent the next 10 years

906
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:40,947
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

907
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:46,631
You were trying to bring her back.

908
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:51,870
But all I learned was we know nothing.

909
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:58,706
It's not your fault.

910
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:02,547
She made her choice.

911
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,581
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

912
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:14,753
I was trying to protect you.

913
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,233
I lost your mother.

914
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:23,108
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

915
01:00:23,941 --> 01:00:25,308
I'm sorry.

916
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:29,949
This is awesome.

917
01:00:31,021 --> 01:00:32,581
It's awesome, you know?

918
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:34,865
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

919
01:00:35,941 --> 01:00:37,388
It's important.

920
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:41,661
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

921
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:43,592
Yes, you did. Yes.

922
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,666
I'm going to make some tea.

923
01:00:52,301 --> 01:00:53,384
Nailed it!

924
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,671
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

925
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:37,301
<i>The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.</i>

926
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:38,541
It's freezing!

927
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:41,110
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

928
01:01:41,941 --> 01:01:44,541
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

929
01:01:44,741 --> 01:01:47,341
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

930
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,101
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

931
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:51,192
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

932
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,061
It's currently collecting dust

933
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:57,261
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

934
01:01:57,461 --> 01:01:59,341
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

935
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,301
You're over the target area.

936
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:03,661
Disengage now, Scott!

937
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:04,901
Squadron A, go!

938
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:06,434
B, go!

939
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:09,944
C, go!

940
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:13,434
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

941
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:17,461
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

942
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:18,710
Stay calm.

943
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,301
Guys?
We might have a problem.

944
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:25,821
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

945
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:27,070
It's not!

946
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,346
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

947
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:34,421
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

948
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:35,581
<i>Abort now!</i>

949
01:02:35,781 --> 01:02:38,421
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

950
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,671
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

951
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,501
He's gonna lose the suit.

952
01:02:42,701 --> 01:02:44,193
He's gonna lose his life.

953
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:52,151
<i>All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.</i>

954
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:54,873
Somebody's home, Scott.

955
01:02:58,021 --> 01:02:59,221
<i>What's going on down there, Sam?</i>

956
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:00,549
It's the Falcon!

957
01:03:01,221 --> 01:03:03,351
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

958
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:04,821
Wait a second.

959
01:03:05,021 --> 01:03:06,861
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

960
01:03:07,061 --> 01:03:08,461
It's okay. He can't see me.

961
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:09,581
I can see you.

962
01:03:09,781 --> 01:03:10,944
He can see me.

963
01:03:13,301 --> 01:03:15,101
Hi. I'm Scott.

964
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:16,821
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

965
01:03:17,021 --> 01:03:20,181
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

966
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:22,033
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

967
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:23,901
I'm Ant-Man.

968
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:25,261
"Ant-Man"?

969
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:27,421
What? You haven't heard of me?

970
01:03:27,621 --> 01:03:29,387
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

971
01:03:29,781 --> 01:03:31,141
You wanna tell me what you want?

972
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:33,621
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

973
01:03:33,821 --> 01:03:35,421
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

974
01:03:35,621 --> 01:03:38,141
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

975
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,754
I know exactly how that is.

976
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:41,581
Located the breach.

977
01:03:41,781 --> 01:03:43,263
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

978
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:49,268
What the hell are you doing?

979
01:03:52,221 --> 01:03:54,943
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

980
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:09,221
Sorry!

981
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:10,913
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

982
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:12,664
That's enough!

983
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:37,387
Ant-thony! A little help!

984
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:51,149
I've lost visual.

985
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:01,541
He's inside my pack!

986
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:02,790
Sorry!

987
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:05,703
You seem like a really great guy.

988
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:34,543
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

989
01:05:37,821 --> 01:05:41,350
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

990
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,264
You jeopardized everything!

991
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:01,827
You got it.

992
01:06:04,821 --> 01:06:05,701
Well done.

993
01:06:05,901 --> 01:06:06,741
Wait a minute.

994
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,221
Did you just compliment me?

995
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:10,903
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

996
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:14,229
I was good, wasn't I?

997
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:19,301
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

998
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:21,861
Let us not dwell on the past.

999
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,191
We gotta finish our planning.

1000
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:28,227
Don't mind him.

1001
01:06:28,741 --> 01:06:29,744
You did good.

1002
01:06:36,621 --> 01:06:37,909
Darren.

1003
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:42,553
How the hell did you get in here?

1004
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:46,024
You left the front door open, Hank.

1005
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:47,261
It's official.

1006
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,624
You're old.

1007
01:06:49,181 --> 01:06:50,344
The plans.

1008
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,347
He will kill him.

1009
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:59,268
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1010
01:07:00,301 --> 01:07:01,661
I have good news.

1011
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:03,103
Really?

1012
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:04,944
What's that?

1013
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:10,061
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1014
01:07:10,261 --> 01:07:13,941
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

1015
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:17,909
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1016
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:25,629
You're welcome.

1017
01:07:29,981 --> 01:07:32,463
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1018
01:07:33,141 --> 01:07:35,145
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1019
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:37,821
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1020
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,309
I'll be there.

1021
01:07:56,381 --> 01:07:57,828
What did you see in me?

1022
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:00,434
I don't know what you mean.

1023
01:08:01,341 --> 01:08:03,821
All those years ago, you picked me.

1024
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:05,513
What did you see?

1025
01:08:07,701 --> 01:08:09,467
I saw myself.

1026
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:12,464
Then why did you push me away?

1027
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:17,345
Because I saw too much of myself.

1028
01:08:28,221 --> 01:08:29,501
<i>He knows. He's baiting you.</i>

1029
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:31,301
We have to call it off.

1030
01:08:31,501 --> 01:08:32,541
We're all taking risks.

1031
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:33,941
What if he saw me here?

1032
01:08:34,141 --> 01:08:35,341
He didn't. There's no way.

1033
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:37,910
How do you know that?

1034
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:46,581
Darren, hi.

1035
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:49,593
Hope, where are you right now?

1036
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:51,301
I'm at home. Why?

1037
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:53,141
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

1038
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:55,021
<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

1039
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:58,661
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1040
01:08:58,861 --> 01:09:01,221
<i>We need to start everyone working
around the clock.</i>

1041
01:09:01,421 --> 01:09:03,101
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.</i>

1042
01:09:03,301 --> 01:09:04,461
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

1043
01:09:04,661 --> 01:09:06,541
Full sensors at all entrances

1044
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:10,061
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1045
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:11,741
Great. Good idea.

1046
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:16,267
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

1047
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:23,061
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1048
01:09:23,261 --> 01:09:25,101
But he is not onto you.

1049
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:27,581
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1050
01:09:27,781 --> 01:09:29,381
and closing exterior vents.

1051
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:31,506
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1052
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:34,548
The water main.

1053
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:37,461
You can't add security to a water main.

1054
01:09:37,661 --> 01:09:39,861
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1055
01:09:40,061 --> 01:09:41,141
that's how I get in.

1056
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:43,421
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1057
01:09:43,621 --> 01:09:44,861
to change the water pressure.

1058
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:47,661
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

1059
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:49,388
So we expand our team.

1060
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:50,861
What do we need?

1061
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,341
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

1062
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:56,261
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1063
01:09:56,461 --> 01:09:57,741
and kill the laser grid,

1064
01:09:57,941 --> 01:10:00,141
and a getaway guy.

1065
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:04,314
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

1066
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:06,261
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1067
01:10:06,461 --> 01:10:09,941
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1068
01:10:10,141 --> 01:10:12,032
Because we just robbed you.

1069
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:17,021
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1070
01:10:17,221 --> 01:10:18,421
Two smoothie machines.

1071
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,061
Are you sure they can handle this?

1072
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:21,541
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1073
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:25,261
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1074
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:27,981
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1075
01:10:28,181 --> 01:10:29,381
We know our business.

1076
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:31,821
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

1077
01:10:32,021 --> 01:10:33,341
I let you.

1078
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:36,701
Well, one could say that
I let you let me.

1079
01:10:36,901 --> 01:10:40,101
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

1080
01:10:40,301 --> 01:10:41,941
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

1081
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:44,501
- I'm in the system?
- You're in the system.

1082
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:45,781
The system?

1083
01:10:45,981 --> 01:10:48,141
Yeah, we're doomed.

1084
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:49,261
All right.

1085
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:51,021
There's something
you guys need to see.

1086
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:52,941
When you get to this corner,

1087
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:55,781
there's gonna be three offices
on your left side.

1088
01:10:55,981 --> 01:10:57,314
Damn!

1089
01:10:58,981 --> 01:11:01,581
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1090
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:04,341
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

1091
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:07,661
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

1092
01:11:07,861 --> 01:11:09,061
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1093
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:10,981
- Really?
- Yeah.

1094
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:12,344
Good.

1095
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:21,301
This is the work of gypsies.

1096
01:11:21,501 --> 01:11:22,501
That's witchcraft.

1097
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:23,864
Wow, that's amazing.

1098
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:25,861
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1099
01:11:26,061 --> 01:11:27,021
That's some kind of wizardry.

1100
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:28,181
This is sorcery!

1101
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:29,381
How'd you do that, bro?

1102
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:31,551
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

1103
01:11:32,061 --> 01:11:33,221
Ahhh!

1104
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:34,741
Get off! Get off!

1105
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:37,469
Wait, I thought
Daddy didn't get scared!

1106
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:41,021
I gave them each half a Xanax

1107
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:43,701
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1108
01:11:43,901 --> 01:11:46,065
They fell right asleep.

1109
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:49,221
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1110
01:11:49,421 --> 01:11:51,221
No, please don't.

1111
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:53,741
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1112
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:57,661
I'm just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1113
01:11:57,861 --> 01:12:00,821
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1114
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:03,581
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1115
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:05,261
to almost liking you.

1116
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:07,192
You really should write poetry.

1117
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:12,272
Get some sleep, Scott.

1118
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:05,461
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

1119
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:07,141
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

1120
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,541
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

1121
01:13:08,741 --> 01:13:10,061
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

1122
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:11,621
You know what?
I get to wear a uniform.

1123
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,301
- That's what's up.
- Luis.

1124
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:15,581
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm just excited.

1125
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:16,981
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1126
01:13:17,181 --> 01:13:18,381
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

1127
01:13:18,581 --> 01:13:19,461
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1128
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,421
- Oh, my Lord.
- She's not my...

1129
01:13:21,621 --> 01:13:23,781
You know what? I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover.

1130
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:25,781
Like a whistling. You know
what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1131
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:28,941
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1132
01:13:29,141 --> 01:13:31,191
It's not <i>The Andy Griffith</i> Show.
No whistling.

1133
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:50,229
All clear in Sector One.

1134
01:13:55,381 --> 01:13:56,544
Step out.

1135
01:13:59,141 --> 01:14:00,349
All clear.

1136
01:14:06,021 --> 01:14:07,149
We're set.

1137
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:09,068
Wish me luck.

1138
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:22,187
Utilities online.

1139
01:14:34,621 --> 01:14:36,432
Hey! What are you doing?

1140
01:14:36,981 --> 01:14:41,591
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

1141
01:14:42,981 --> 01:14:44,314
I'm the boss.

1142
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:46,073
- Oh.
- Utilities 1.3...

1143
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:02,305
<i>Water level is dropping!</i>

1144
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:32,541
<i>Coming up on extraction pipe.</i>

1145
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,154
All right, I see it.

1146
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:45,625
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1147
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:51,872
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1148
01:15:56,341 --> 01:15:58,664
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1149
01:16:09,061 --> 01:16:11,021
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1150
01:16:11,221 --> 01:16:14,147
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1151
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:18,101
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1152
01:16:18,301 --> 01:16:19,381
This is problem?

1153
01:16:19,581 --> 01:16:21,501
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

1154
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:22,864
for undercover cops, man,

1155
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:25,034
yes, this is problem.

1156
01:16:28,861 --> 01:16:30,024
That's Pym.

1157
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:33,981
Oh, no.

1158
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:35,341
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1159
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:36,941
<i>Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...</i>

1160
01:16:37,141 --> 01:16:40,067
<i>I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.</i>

1161
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:42,509
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

1162
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:49,788
Ow! Ow!

1163
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,541
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1164
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,021
That's what I call
an unfortunate casualty

1165
01:16:56,221 --> 01:16:58,225
in a very serious operation.

1166
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,591
Signal decoy in place.

1167
01:17:10,141 --> 01:17:12,066
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1168
01:17:13,301 --> 01:17:15,461
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1169
01:17:15,661 --> 01:17:17,221
Scott, we have problem.

1170
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:19,346
<i>Problem? What's the problem?</i>

1171
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,541
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1172
01:17:22,741 --> 01:17:24,261
Listen to me.

1173
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:28,263
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

1174
01:17:28,901 --> 01:17:30,632
That's awfully dramatic.

1175
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:34,789
Are you kidding me?

1176
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:41,027
Problem solved.

1177
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:57,149
Well...

1178
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:00,786
How do I look?

1179
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:11,064
There he is.

1180
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:15,866
Just in time. Come on.

1181
01:18:25,181 --> 01:18:26,941
<i>12-point verification.</i>

1182
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:28,821
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

1183
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:30,421
<i>Confirming authorization level.</i>

1184
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:32,101
Well, you can never be too safe.

1185
01:18:32,301 --> 01:18:33,823
<i>Access granted.</i>

1186
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:42,513
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1187
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:45,021
You really did it.

1188
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,066
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1189
01:19:13,261 --> 01:19:14,913
Arriving in second position.

1190
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:18,871
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

1191
01:19:29,861 --> 01:19:31,149
Proceeding to command position.

1192
01:19:48,941 --> 01:19:50,547
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1193
01:19:52,461 --> 01:19:54,421
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1194
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:56,181
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1195
01:19:56,381 --> 01:19:58,670
No, no, no, no, no!

1196
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:01,109
Did you see that?

1197
01:20:07,581 --> 01:20:09,021
Assume formation.

1198
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,021
All right, you cute little crazies,

1199
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:12,952
let's fry these servers!

1200
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:27,265
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1201
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:40,661
<i>Servers are fried.</i>

1202
01:20:40,861 --> 01:20:42,941
Data backup completely erased.

1203
01:20:43,141 --> 01:20:44,747
Heading to the particle chamber.

1204
01:20:51,261 --> 01:20:53,106
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1205
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,341
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

1206
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:00,581
Wonderful.

1207
01:21:00,781 --> 01:21:03,501
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

1208
01:21:03,701 --> 01:21:05,181
They're representatives of Hydra.

1209
01:21:05,381 --> 01:21:06,581
They're not what they were.

1210
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:08,941
They're doing some interesting work.

1211
01:21:09,141 --> 01:21:11,589
And I'm enjoying myself.

1212
01:21:12,341 --> 01:21:14,381
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

1213
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:16,551
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1214
01:21:20,461 --> 01:21:21,510
Wow.

1215
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:25,781
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming
a mile away,

1216
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,941
but I just figured it'd
be all pathetic and weak.

1217
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:29,668
Well, you figured wrong.

1218
01:21:30,861 --> 01:21:32,194
I know this van.

1219
01:21:33,621 --> 01:21:34,784
Anybody home?

1220
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:41,624
All right, guys. I'm here.

1221
01:21:46,221 --> 01:21:48,032
I'm setting the charges.

1222
01:22:06,701 --> 01:22:09,912
Great job, guys.
I'll take it from here.

1223
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:21,629
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1224
01:22:22,581 --> 01:22:23,584
Final position.

1225
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:34,381
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1226
01:22:34,581 --> 01:22:36,021
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

1227
01:22:36,221 --> 01:22:37,703
- I'm getting close!
- No, you're not.

1228
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:43,861
San Francisco P.D.!

1229
01:22:44,061 --> 01:22:45,064
Out of the van!

1230
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:46,541
I know you're in there!

1231
01:22:46,741 --> 01:22:48,905
- Make it go faster.
- Dude, seriously.

1232
01:22:54,621 --> 01:22:56,581
Ready to jump.
Do you read, Kurt?

1233
01:22:56,781 --> 01:22:57,784
So close.

1234
01:22:58,581 --> 01:22:59,861
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
- Freeze!

1235
01:23:00,061 --> 01:23:01,581
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

1236
01:23:01,781 --> 01:23:03,581
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

1237
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:05,141
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I'm coming.

1238
01:23:05,341 --> 01:23:07,021
Take it easy!

1239
01:23:07,221 --> 01:23:09,191
No, I will not move! Go now!

1240
01:23:11,341 --> 01:23:13,391
- Wait!
- What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1241
01:23:20,301 --> 01:23:21,304
Phew!

1242
01:23:23,941 --> 01:23:24,944
What? What?

1243
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:27,869
Hey, little guy.

1244
01:23:40,581 --> 01:23:43,581
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

1245
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:44,621
Which begs the question,

1246
01:23:44,821 --> 01:23:46,861
who is the new Ant-Man?

1247
01:23:47,061 --> 01:23:49,381
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

1248
01:23:49,581 --> 01:23:51,472
trusted even more than me?

1249
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:55,990
Scott Lang.

1250
01:23:57,221 --> 01:23:58,701
A martyr

1251
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:01,221
who took on the system
and paid the price,

1252
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:04,901
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

1253
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:08,346
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1254
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:14,144
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

1255
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:18,310
And then he disappears magically,

1256
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:21,501
despite having no money to his name.

1257
01:24:21,701 --> 01:24:24,388
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1258
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:30,381
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1259
01:24:30,581 --> 01:24:33,901
Darren, don't do this.

1260
01:24:34,101 --> 01:24:36,021
If you sell to these men,

1261
01:24:36,221 --> 01:24:37,541
it's gonna be chaos.

1262
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:39,021
I already have.

1263
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,541
And for twice the price,

1264
01:24:40,741 --> 01:24:42,661
thanks to you.

1265
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:46,101
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

1266
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:48,141
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1267
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:52,189
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1268
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:54,501
They don't run on diesel.

1269
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:57,593
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

1270
01:24:58,741 --> 01:25:00,421
What do you call the only man

1271
01:25:00,621 --> 01:25:03,593
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

1272
01:25:04,221 --> 01:25:06,741
The most powerful man in the world.

1273
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:08,341
You proud of me yet?

1274
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:11,461
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

1275
01:25:11,661 --> 01:25:15,384
It's been too late for a long time now.

1276
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:18,391
Darren!

1277
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:20,501
What are you doing?

1278
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:23,781
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

1279
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:25,621
This is not who you are.

1280
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:28,633
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

1281
01:25:36,981 --> 01:25:39,031
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1282
01:25:40,741 --> 01:25:43,428
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

1283
01:25:46,021 --> 01:25:47,309
Here we go.

1284
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:51,912
Drop your gun.

1285
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:57,341
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

1286
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:58,501
but you were there.

1287
01:25:58,701 --> 01:26:02,101
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

1288
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:03,583
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1289
01:26:05,341 --> 01:26:06,421
but I think I am now!

1290
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:08,621
Drop your gun now!

1291
01:26:08,821 --> 01:26:12,191
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1292
01:26:24,421 --> 01:26:26,425
Dad!

1293
01:26:35,141 --> 01:26:36,261
Hank, no.

1294
01:26:36,461 --> 01:26:38,113
No, Hank.

1295
01:26:38,701 --> 01:26:40,541
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1296
01:26:40,741 --> 01:26:42,823
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1297
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:46,707
Take the suit off,
or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

1298
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:14,301
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

1299
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:15,861
Request immediate backup!

1300
01:27:16,061 --> 01:27:17,349
Go, go, go!

1301
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:32,021
Get me to the roof.

1302
01:27:32,221 --> 01:27:33,341
And radio ahead.

1303
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:36,261
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

1304
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:37,381
You two,

1305
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:40,141
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

1306
01:27:40,341 --> 01:27:43,552
Dad, can you move?

1307
01:27:45,901 --> 01:27:47,314
We need to get him out of here.

1308
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:51,229
Go get that suit.

1309
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:35,501
Hey, Scotty.

1310
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:37,432
Hey, did I save your life?

1311
01:28:38,581 --> 01:28:41,189
Scotty?

1312
01:28:43,581 --> 01:28:45,061
Thank you, Luis.

1313
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:46,701
- Are we the good guys?
- Yeah.

1314
01:28:46,901 --> 01:28:49,184
- We're the good guys, right?
- Yeah, we're the good guys.

1315
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:51,341
Feels kinda weird, you know.

1316
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:53,501
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1317
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:55,785
Get out of here before this place blows!

1318
01:29:02,461 --> 01:29:05,751
Damn it! That guy.

1319
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:09,031
Hey! We're getting out of here!

1320
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:14,461
The charges are set.

1321
01:29:14,661 --> 01:29:16,541
We've gotta find a way out of here.
And fast.

1322
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:18,541
Don't worry.

1323
01:29:18,741 --> 01:29:21,181
I'm not gonna die.

1324
01:29:21,381 --> 01:29:22,828
And neither are you.

1325
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:26,429
It's not a keychain.

1326
01:29:29,501 --> 01:29:32,473
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

1327
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:45,027
And there's a tank.

1328
01:29:54,581 --> 01:29:56,153
A little help!

1329
01:29:57,661 --> 01:29:58,789
I got it.

1330
01:29:59,581 --> 01:30:01,028
We need a doctor!

1331
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:03,583
We've got him.

1332
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:07,353
Thank you.

1333
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:10,267
Let's go!

1334
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:27,708
Ant-thony!

1335
01:30:41,021 --> 01:30:42,309
Go!

1336
01:30:43,581 --> 01:30:44,863
You're gonna regret that.

1337
01:30:55,101 --> 01:30:56,661
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

1338
01:30:56,861 --> 01:30:58,301
- What?
- Get out of that van!

1339
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:00,383
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

1340
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:03,943
Hey! Hey!

1341
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:10,901
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

1342
01:31:11,101 --> 01:31:12,628
The windows!

1343
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:19,821
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

1344
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:21,593
It was never just a heist!

1345
01:31:43,781 --> 01:31:45,273
Put the gun down!

1346
01:31:53,861 --> 01:31:55,991
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

1347
01:32:12,261 --> 01:32:14,311
We gotta set her down somewhere.

1348
01:32:44,301 --> 01:32:46,541
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1349
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:48,343
<i>Playing Disintegration
by the Cure.</i>

1350
01:33:26,941 --> 01:33:28,024
Call 911!

1351
01:33:46,341 --> 01:33:48,107
It's okay.

1352
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:54,511
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

1353
01:33:57,061 --> 01:33:57,941
Scott?

1354
01:33:58,141 --> 01:33:59,463
Paxton, you have to listen to me!

1355
01:34:27,741 --> 01:34:29,901
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!

1356
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:31,981
I am taking you back. To prison.

1357
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:34,541
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1358
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:35,824
In the bug zapper. There...

1359
01:34:37,621 --> 01:34:40,861
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

1360
01:34:41,061 --> 01:34:45,261
<i>All units, we have a 2-36
in progress at 840 Winter Street.</i>

1361
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:46,794
- Cassie!
- That's my house.

1362
01:35:04,381 --> 01:35:05,669
Don't be scared.

1363
01:35:06,661 --> 01:35:07,821
Paxton, let me help!

1364
01:35:08,021 --> 01:35:09,901
- Don't move.
- Let me help!

1365
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:12,061
- Maggie! What's going on?
- He's got Cassie!

1366
01:35:12,261 --> 01:35:13,701
- Who's got Cassie, honey?
- That thing.

1367
01:35:13,901 --> 01:35:16,023
- Thing?
- I don't know! I don't know!

1368
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:25,827
Are you a monster?

1369
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,385
Do I look like a monster?

1370
01:35:30,421 --> 01:35:31,868
I want my daddy!

1371
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:34,954
I want your daddy, too.

1372
01:35:38,701 --> 01:35:39,621
There you are.

1373
01:35:39,821 --> 01:35:41,188
Daddy, is that you?

1374
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:43,824
Hi, peanut.

1375
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:46,984
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1376
01:36:00,261 --> 01:36:03,028
Now, where did you go, little guy?

1377
01:36:08,061 --> 01:36:09,189
There you are.

1378
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:14,474
Not just me!

1379
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:26,463
Damn it!

1380
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:28,753
Go! Go!

1381
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:24,021
Scotty needs us,
you know what I'm saying?

1382
01:37:24,221 --> 01:37:26,066
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1383
01:37:28,781 --> 01:37:29,781
Back it up.

1384
01:37:29,981 --> 01:37:31,861
- Back it up, slow.
- Yeah.

1385
01:37:32,061 --> 01:37:33,381
- Back it up.
- Yeah.

1386
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:35,028
- Back it up.
- Okay.

1387
01:37:36,181 --> 01:37:37,741
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

1388
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:39,181
- Back it up.
- That's right.

1389
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:42,061
- Backin' up?
- Yep, just backin' up.

1390
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:43,469
No, no. Just back it up.

1391
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:52,231
You insult me, Scott.

1392
01:37:56,501 --> 01:38:00,303
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1393
01:38:01,941 --> 01:38:05,504
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

1394
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:09,029
Yeah, I agree.

1395
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:31,664
Cassie!

1396
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:42,430
I'm gonna show you
just how insignificant you are.

1397
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:46,029
Cassie! I'm coming!

1398
01:38:58,821 --> 01:39:00,341
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1399
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:01,541
I'm gonna destroy

1400
01:39:01,741 --> 01:39:03,313
everything you love.

1401
01:39:04,901 --> 01:39:06,473
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1402
01:39:14,301 --> 01:39:15,634
I can't break through.

1403
01:39:16,581 --> 01:39:18,631
It's titanium, you idiot!

1404
01:39:24,781 --> 01:39:26,751
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1405
01:39:27,901 --> 01:39:29,141
Sorry, sweetheart.

1406
01:39:29,341 --> 01:39:31,661
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

1407
01:39:31,861 --> 01:39:33,061
- You stay behind me, okay?
- Okay.

1408
01:39:33,261 --> 01:39:34,264
Stay behind me.

1409
01:39:35,661 --> 01:39:38,541
I'm gonna have to shrink
between the molecules to get in there.

1410
01:39:38,741 --> 01:39:40,791
Get away from us!

1411
01:39:42,661 --> 01:39:43,541
Daddy, help!

1412
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:45,347
I love you, Cassie.

1413
01:40:15,101 --> 01:40:16,548

<i>You could go subatomic.</i>

01:42:51,781 --> 01:42:52,944
Sorry.

1438
01:42:55,741 --> 01:42:57,711
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1439
01:42:59,781 --> 01:43:00,784
Mommy!

1440
01:43:03,661 --> 01:43:05,267
She's fine, she's fine.

1441
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:16,193
<i>Scott, please.</i>

1442
01:43:16,861 --> 01:43:18,621
You don't remember anything?

1443
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:19,901
Hank. I don't.

1444
01:43:20,101 --> 01:43:22,470
There must be something else.

1445
01:43:24,181 --> 01:43:27,181
Well, I suppose the human mind

1446
01:43:27,381 --> 01:43:30,068
just can't comprehend the experience,

1447
01:43:32,141 --> 01:43:33,474
but you made it.

1448
01:43:34,141 --> 01:43:35,793
You went in,

1449
01:43:37,141 --> 01:43:38,872
and you got out.

1450
01:43:41,061 --> 01:43:42,667
It's amazing.

1451
01:43:43,341 --> 01:43:44,981
Scott,

1452
01:43:45,181 --> 01:43:47,106
I'll walk you out.

1453
01:43:51,061 --> 01:43:52,588
Get some rest.

1454
01:44:00,821 --> 01:44:03,224
Is it possible?

1455
01:44:21,101 --> 01:44:22,021
When did this happen?

1456
01:44:22,221 --> 01:44:23,221
Nothing's happening.

1457
01:44:23,421 --> 01:44:25,541
Whoa. Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

1458
01:44:25,741 --> 01:44:27,661
Well, if that's the case,

1459
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:29,388
shoot me again.

1460
01:44:29,741 --> 01:44:32,221
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1461
01:44:32,421 --> 01:44:34,221
I'm a little surprised myself.

1462
01:44:34,421 --> 01:44:36,661
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

1463
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:38,353
Really, Hope.

1464
01:44:39,181 --> 01:44:40,548
- Scott.
- Yeah?

1465
01:44:41,141 --> 01:44:42,872
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah.

1466
01:44:44,301 --> 01:44:46,101
Scott,
I met with my captain today.

1467
01:44:46,301 --> 01:44:48,988
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1468
01:44:49,621 --> 01:44:51,063
Something happened with the cameras.

1469
01:44:51,781 --> 01:44:53,990
Some circuits got fried.

1470
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:57,221
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1471
01:44:57,421 --> 01:44:58,421
Really?

1472
01:44:58,621 --> 01:45:00,068
Well, yeah.

1473
01:45:01,861 --> 01:45:04,661
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1474
01:45:04,861 --> 01:45:06,701
Thank you, Paxton.

1475
01:45:06,901 --> 01:45:08,348
I'm blown away.

1476
01:45:09,141 --> 01:45:10,821
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1477
01:45:11,021 --> 01:45:13,071
Well, that's my pleasure.

1478
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:17,432
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1479
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:20,741
- This is awkward.
- Yeah.

1480
01:45:20,941 --> 01:45:22,621
Yeah.

1481
01:45:22,821 --> 01:45:24,181
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

1482
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:25,621
- Oh, I know.
- What?

1483
01:45:25,821 --> 01:45:28,261
- I did my first cartwheel today.
- What?

1484
01:45:28,461 --> 01:45:30,941
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1485
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:32,421
But today was the magic day.

1486
01:45:32,621 --> 01:45:33,903
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1487
01:45:35,341 --> 01:45:37,581
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

1488
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:39,221
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it is.

1489
01:45:39,421 --> 01:45:41,461
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

1490
01:45:41,661 --> 01:45:42,789
Yeah, that's her.

1491
01:45:43,741 --> 01:45:45,313
Good boy.

1492
01:45:47,221 --> 01:45:49,954
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1493
01:45:52,901 --> 01:45:53,904
Sorry.

1494
01:45:55,581 --> 01:45:57,312
It's work.

1495
01:45:57,941 --> 01:45:59,229
Yeah.

1496
01:46:00,941 --> 01:46:01,781
All right.

1497
01:46:01,981 --> 01:46:03,621
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1498
01:46:03,821 --> 01:46:05,021
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1499
01:46:05,221 --> 01:46:08,981
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1500
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:10,741
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1501
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:13,181
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1502
01:46:13,381 --> 01:46:15,461
<i>And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.</i>

1503
01:46:15,661 --> 01:46:17,781
<i>But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?</i>

1504
01:46:17,981 --> 01:46:20,581
<i>But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!</i>

1505
01:46:20,781 --> 01:46:22,781
- Luis.
- Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1506
01:46:22,981 --> 01:46:24,861
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1507
01:46:25,061 --> 01:46:26,901
<i>But anyway, Ignacio tells me,</i>

1508
01:46:27,101 --> 01:46:30,621
<i>"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.</i>

1509
01:46:30,821 --> 01:46:33,061
<i>"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,</i>

1510
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:34,821
<i>"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

1511
01:46:35,021 --> 01:46:36,181
<i>"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"</i>

1512
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:38,901
<i>The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."</i>

1513
01:46:39,101 --> 01:46:40,901
<i>So this writer chick tells Ignacio,</i>

1514
01:46:41,101 --> 01:46:43,781
<i>"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,</i>

1515
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:45,581
<i>"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,</i>

1516
01:46:45,781 --> 01:46:46,621
<i>"you know what I'm saying?"</i>

1517
01:46:46,821 --> 01:46:48,221
<i>Ignacio's like, "For real?"</i>

1518
01:46:48,421 --> 01:46:51,261
<i>And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,</i>

1519
01:46:51,461 --> 01:46:52,741
<i>"because he works with the Avengers."</i>

1520
01:46:52,941 --> 01:46:54,101
Oh, no.

1521
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:56,581
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1522
01:46:56,781 --> 01:46:57,821
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1523
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:59,941
<i>"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,</i>

1524
01:47:00,141 --> 01:47:01,141
<i>"who's flashing his fresh tack,</i>

1525
01:47:01,341 --> 01:47:03,781
<i>"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"</i>

1526
01:47:03,981 --> 01:47:06,981
<i>And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.</i>

1527
01:47:07,181 --> 01:47:09,141
<i>"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.</i>

1528
01:47:09,341 --> 01:47:10,941
<i>"You gotta be more specific."</i>

1529
01:47:11,141 --> 01:47:12,861
<i>And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."</i>

1530
01:47:13,061 --> 01:47:16,381
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1531
01:47:16,581 --> 01:47:17,501
So I asked Ignacio,

1532
01:47:17,701 --> 01:47:19,621
<i>"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick</i>

1533
01:47:19,821 --> 01:47:21,941
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1534
01:47:22,141 --> 01:47:23,383
"that he's looking for him?"

1535
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,594
And? What'd he say?

1536
01:47:29,861 --> 01:47:31,308
He said, "Yes."

1537
01:49:26,381 --> 01:49:28,670
There's something I want to show you.

1538
01:49:30,861 --> 01:49:34,151
I realized you can't destroy power.

1539
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:39,748
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1540
01:49:46,461 --> 01:49:48,461
This is an advanced prototype

1541
01:49:48,661 --> 01:49:51,553
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1542
01:49:52,941 --> 01:49:55,674
She never got to use it.

1543
01:49:56,301 --> 01:50:00,706
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1544
01:50:07,341 --> 01:50:09,869
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1545
01:50:16,501 --> 01:50:18,904
It's about damn time.

1546
01:56:19,221 --> 01:56:20,634
<i>Hey, Cap!</i>

1547
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:37,221
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

1548
01:56:37,421 --> 01:56:39,221
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1549
01:56:39,421 --> 01:56:40,301
Even if he did...

1550
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:42,232
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1551
01:56:43,781 --> 01:56:45,308
We're on our own.

1552
01:56:46,701 --> 01:56:48,034
Maybe not.

1553
01:56:50,301 --> 01:56:51,748
I know a guy.
