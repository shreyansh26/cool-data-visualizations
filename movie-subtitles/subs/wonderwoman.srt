<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

<i>fair and good,

74
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,741
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

75
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:50,912
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

76
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,332
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

77

<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

<i>He turned them against one another</i>

1814
02:09:29,721 --> 02:09:33,475
<i>To end war and bring peace to mankind.</i>

1815
02:09:34,059 --> 02:09:37,896
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light</i>

02:09:38,814 --> 02:09:41,150
<i>and learned that inside
every one of them,</i>

1822
02:10:01,503 --> 02:10:03,172
<i>So, I stay,</i>

1823
02:10:03,338 --> 02:10:05,507
<i>I fight, and I give,</i>
