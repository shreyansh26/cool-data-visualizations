1
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,138
Is it ready?

2
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,197
<i>Hey! That's a great punch.</i>

3
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,495
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

4
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:31,263
Breathe. Breathe.

5
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:40,693
Wait.

6
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,592
Okay.

7
00:06:57,608 --> 00:07:00,728
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

8
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,985
Okay. Okay.

9
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,796
Shut that off! Turn it off!

10
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:33,805
Watch out!

11
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,040
Okay!

12
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,464
That's not right.

13
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,575
Oh, you.

14
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,923
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

15
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,102
Damn it!

16
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,832
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

17
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,212
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

18
00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:03,306
<i>A man drank one of those guarana sodas.</i>

19
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:07,843
<i>Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.</i>

20
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:10,178
Wow.

21
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:16,527
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

22
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:20,439
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

23
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,902
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

24
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:48,095
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

25
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,228
And I pulled you one ace.

26
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:59,653
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

27
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,528
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

28
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,822
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

29
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,870
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

30
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,094
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

31
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:29,092
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

32
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,510
but live fire is for backup only.

33
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,225
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

34
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:35,939
Is he a fighter?

35
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:40,269
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

36
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,604
who stole military secrets.

37
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:47,277
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

38
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,201
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

39
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,374
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

40
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,295
Tranq him and bring him back.

41
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:40,374
Oh, come on.

42
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,642
Camera.

43
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:48,402
Here we go.

44
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:02,587
Get rid of the damn dog.

45
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:15,471
Take him!

46
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,106
Target's on the move.

47
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:38,863
Where is he?

48
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:46,459
He's on the ground.

49
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,292
- Let's go!
- Go!

50
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,209
Move, move!

51
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,408
Go, go, go!

52
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,322
Go! Go!

53
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,999
Clear everyone out!

54
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:24,415
Do not lose him!

55
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:11,500
Oh! No!

56
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:24,410
Get around behind him!

57
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,579
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

58
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,470
Oh, no.

59
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,679
You got to be kidding me.

60
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:20,544
<i>- Where is he?
- Target acquired.</i>

61
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,563
Gringo!

62
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,074
Let's go.

63
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:06,881
No!

64
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,227
Please! No!

65
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,058
Not the computer!

66
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,691
Gimme that! No!

67
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:36,415
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

68
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,290
Oh, no.

69
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,216
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

70
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,276
Anybody else seeing this?

71
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:41,311
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.

72
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:44,358
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

73
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:45,990
<i>Do it now!</i>

74
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:56,115
Go live! Go live! Go live!

75
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,001
Move!
- Get out of the way!

76
00:23:58,546 --> 00:23:59,660
No!

77
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,785
It's behind us! Move! Move!

78
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,663
Get him!

79
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:47,500
Shoot!

80
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,476
Leave me alone.

81
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:16,964
No! No!

82
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:31,937
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

83
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:34,358
He had it on him when he bolted.

84
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,827
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

85
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,710
She is no longer a factor.

86
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,252
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

87
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:57,390
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

88
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,815
Forgive me, sir?

89
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:11,319
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

90
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:14,157
He didn't lose us.

91
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:18,025
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

92
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,446
And then something hit us, something...

93
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,374
Something big hit us!

94
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:28,663
It threw a forklift
truck like it was a softball!

95
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:34,334
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

96
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,845
Well, it's gone.

97
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:40,849
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

98
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:44,055
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

99
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,973
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

100
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,934
It

101
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:54,989
was Banner.

102
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:59,280
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

103
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,532
You've done a good job.

104
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:09,212
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

105
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:14,773
Wait.

106
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:18,693
Please.

107
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:27,332
Where am I?

108
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,953
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

109
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,153
I've seen good men go down

110
00:30:07,248 --> 00:30:10,498
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

111
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,951
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

112
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,421
I mean, that's the job.

113
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:15,703
But this?

114
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,385
This is a whole new level of weird.

115
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:23,340
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

116
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:26,467
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

117
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,391
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

118
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,555
because if that thing shows up again,

119
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:37,356
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

120
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,103
Sir.

121
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,449
<i>Tienes más stretchy?</i>

122
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,492
<i>Yeah. Perfecto.</i>

123
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,989
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you

124
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:12,411
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

125
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:18,454
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.

126
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:23,172
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

127
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:25,832
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

128
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:27,719
Yeah, Super Soldier.

129
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:31,262
Yes.

130
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:34,349
An oversimplification, but yes.

131
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:39,102
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

132
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,896
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

133
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:44,192
We were tryin' to make you better.

134
00:32:47,658 --> 00:32:52,949
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

135
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,612
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

136
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,911
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

137
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:03,629
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

138
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:06,503
And something went very wrong.

139
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:10,845
Or it went very right.

140
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:15,762
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

141
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:18,807
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

142
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:21,021
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

143
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:23,101
You were trying other things.

144
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:26,064
One serum we developed

145
00:33:27,323 --> 00:33:28,651
was very promising.

146
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,362
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

147
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:34,578
He is not one of us.

148
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:42,003
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.

149
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:46,373
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

150
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:47,712
So get out of the trenches.

151
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:50,257
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

152
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:54,593
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.

153
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,887
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

154
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,730
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

155
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,604
I could probably arrange
something like that.

156
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,496
Take care, kids.

157
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,266
Stan, I give you my word,

158
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,058
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

159
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:46,310
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

160
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:49,149
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

161
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,982
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

162
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,314
She doesn't know that I'm here.

163
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:03,495
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

164
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:06,997
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

165
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:11,920
Good. That's good.

166
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:16,834
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

167
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:20,795
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

168
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:24,847
There is one other thing.

169
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,683
Excuse me. Pardon me.

170
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:33,770
Coming through.

171
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,316
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

172
00:37:41,243 --> 00:37:42,738
I don't think there's anybody up there.

173
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:47,289
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

174
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,828
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

175
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,840
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

176
00:38:05,393 --> 00:38:06,507
All right.

177
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,358
Okay.

178
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:21,273
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

179
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:23,769
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

180
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:26,657
Oh, kids.

181
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,318
I got nothing but marinara now.

182
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:31,451
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

183
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:33,745
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

184
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:42,580
Stan?

185
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,339
And he... I go, "So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

186
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:50,470
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil. "

187
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:53,049
And he goes, "Not where you been at. "

188
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:56,844
I thought, "Oh, my God. "
I just felt so awful.

189
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:25,836
Bruce?

190
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:35,469
Betty? What's going on?

191
00:41:50,826 --> 00:41:51,941
Betty...

192
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:55,120
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

193
00:41:56,415 --> 00:42:00,116
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

194
00:42:41,502 --> 00:42:44,123
Don't go. Don't go.

195
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:55,930
I want you to come with me now.

196
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:58,223
Please. Come with me.

197
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:00,890
Please.

198
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,552
It's our data.

199
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:36,513
I got in there before
they carted it all away.

200
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:42,433
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

201
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:49,436
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

202
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:51,854
I haven't spoken to him
in a couple of years.

203
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:53,442
You have to be sure.

204
00:43:53,532 --> 00:43:58,574
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

205
00:43:58,662 --> 00:44:03,621
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

206
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:06,959
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

207
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:09,204
He wants to make it a weapon.

208
00:45:01,183 --> 00:45:02,464
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:07,517
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

210
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,983
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

211
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:16,486
Really? You can't stay at all?

212
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:19,907
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

213
00:45:22,455 --> 00:45:25,206
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

214
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,915
I need to take a bus.

215
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:29,706
Well, at least
let me walk you to the station.

216
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:32,787
Okay.

217
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:39,127
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

218
00:45:42,308 --> 00:45:43,387
I...

219
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,890
What?

220
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:50,348
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:45:50,441 --> 00:45:52,434
I hope you get some rest.

222
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:37,190
We're giving you a very low dose only.

223
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,199
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

224
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:42,275
First sign of any side effect,

225
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:46,033
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

226
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,574
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

227
00:46:52,503 --> 00:46:55,255
You'll get two separate infusions.

228
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:59,551
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.

229
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:01,924
The bone ones are going to hurt.

230
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,302
Is everything okay?

231
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:53,646
I think so.

232
00:48:02,031 --> 00:48:03,359
Come here.

233
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:07,073
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

234
00:48:08,287 --> 00:48:10,327
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

235
00:48:15,127 --> 00:48:16,621
It feels too tight, huh?

236
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:18,504
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

237
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:28,972
- What?
- They're here.

238
00:48:29,308 --> 00:48:30,719
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

239
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,055
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

240
00:48:32,144 --> 00:48:33,639
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

241
00:48:44,824 --> 00:48:46,947
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

242
00:48:47,034 --> 00:48:48,576
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

243
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,028
He's heading 2-7-0.

244
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:10,841
Blonsky! Not yet!

245
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:13,472
Sir.

246
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:16,728
Look alive. This could get interesting.

247
00:50:04,737 --> 00:50:05,816
I got him!

248
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:09,198
Stop! Stop!

249
00:50:11,035 --> 00:50:12,410
I know you're in there!

250
00:50:14,246 --> 00:50:15,871
General, please!

251
00:50:18,376 --> 00:50:19,407
Sir?

252
00:50:20,044 --> 00:50:21,123
Dad!

253
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:32,722
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

254
00:50:32,807 --> 00:50:34,633
There he is!

255
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:36,932
<i>Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.</i>

256
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:39,178
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

257
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,444
He's locked in.

258
00:50:52,451 --> 00:50:53,993
Put two canisters in there with him.

259
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,735
Fire!

260
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:16,011
Get her back here!

261
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:51,541
Now she'll see.

262
00:52:14,408 --> 00:52:15,523
Alpha team?

263
00:52:17,536 --> 00:52:18,616
Let him have all of it.

264
00:52:24,877 --> 00:52:26,371
Come on, light him up!

265
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:32,965
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

266
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:22,340
Oh, my God!

267
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,011
Blonsky, now you're up!

268
00:53:27,732 --> 00:53:28,846
Sir?

269
00:53:30,026 --> 00:53:31,306
Cover me.

270
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,914
Remember me?

271
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,275
My God, he's doing it.

272
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:18,651
Move him toward the cannons!

273
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:25,868
Move!

274
00:54:39,387 --> 00:54:40,632
Hold your position!

275
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:42,050
Do it now!

276
00:55:07,915 --> 00:55:09,457
Please, please, please, no!

277
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:10,952
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

278
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:12,074
You're killing him!

279
00:55:12,169 --> 00:55:14,495
Stop! Get off of me!

280
00:55:14,588 --> 00:55:15,999
Bruce!

281
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:23,008
Bruce! Bruce!

282
00:55:52,377 --> 00:55:53,408
Where's the gunship?

283
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:14,686
Is that it?

284
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,691
Blonsky, pull back now.

285
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,057
<i>Pull back!</i>

286
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:22,989
Is that all you got?

287
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,114
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

288
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,585
Find cover!

289
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,788
Betty!

290
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:54,766
Fire, goddamn it!

291
00:56:56,566 --> 00:56:57,765
Bruce?

292
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:12,154
Stop firing!

293
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:27,131
No!

294
00:58:17,272 --> 00:58:19,810
You did the right thing, calling us.

295
00:58:21,943 --> 00:58:24,861
I need to know where they're going.

296
00:58:24,946 --> 00:58:27,105
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

297
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,479
From who?

298
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:31,989
He protected her. You almost killed her.

299
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,827
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

300
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:38,621
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

301
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,628
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

302
00:58:41,964 --> 00:58:43,043
And you are.

303
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:46,583
I don't know where he's going.

304
00:58:47,552 --> 00:58:51,716
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

305
00:58:53,016 --> 00:58:55,554
And I can't help either one of them.

306
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:03,691
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

307
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:05,444
Now I know!

308
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:12,692
Where does she meet these guys?

309
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,373
Bruce?

310
01:00:13,597 --> 01:00:14,759
Bruce.

311
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:37,110
It's okay. It's okay.

312
01:00:50,258 --> 01:00:53,010
Come here. Come this way.

313
01:00:56,223 --> 01:00:57,847
Watch your head.

314
01:01:12,948 --> 01:01:14,062
Okay.

315
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:26,039
We're okay.

316
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:32,341
It's okay.

317
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:35,885
It's just the rain.

318
01:01:45,147 --> 01:01:47,353
Will he ever walk again?

319
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:51,023
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

320
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:54,895
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

321
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:58,193
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

322
01:03:00,764 --> 01:03:01,879
Here.

323
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:04,596
Okay.

324
01:03:45,267 --> 01:03:46,465
Bruce?

325
01:03:47,978 --> 01:03:49,223
Oh, hi.

326
01:03:49,813 --> 01:03:50,928
Are you okay?

327
01:03:51,565 --> 01:03:52,679
Yeah.

328
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:55,141
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

329
01:03:55,235 --> 01:03:57,809
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

330
01:03:59,364 --> 01:04:00,479
You ate it?

331
01:04:00,574 --> 01:04:04,821
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

332
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:05,991
Wow.

333
01:04:07,497 --> 01:04:11,827
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

334
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:14,492
First thing's first.

335
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:16,212
Oh, you're kidding me.

336
01:04:26,475 --> 01:04:27,589
What?

337
01:04:28,185 --> 01:04:31,020
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

338
01:04:31,104 --> 01:04:32,433
I'll take my chances.

339
01:04:32,648 --> 01:04:35,139
<i>Rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash</i>

340
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:39,017
<i>between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary</i>

341
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:42,066
<i>on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.</i>

342
01:04:42,157 --> 01:04:45,407
<i>Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.</i>

343
01:04:45,494 --> 01:04:46,952
<i>It was so big.</i>

344
01:04:47,037 --> 01:04:49,907
<i>- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.</i>

345
01:04:49,998 --> 01:04:53,035
<i>McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,</i>

346
01:04:53,126 --> 01:04:54,834
<i>captured this on his cell phone.</i>

347
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,628
<i>Further search for the mysterious "hulk"</i>

348
01:04:56,713 --> 01:05:01,209
<i>was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.</i>

349
01:05:08,725 --> 01:05:11,679
Not too short back there.

350
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:14,226
I have done this before, you know.

351
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:32,695
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

352
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:34,700
With clippers, usually.

353
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:32,261
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

354
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:33,726
We can't do this.

355
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,886
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

356
01:06:36,938 --> 01:06:38,018
No.

357
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:40,436
I can't.

358
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:45,980
I can't get too excited.

359
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,776
Not even a little excited?

360
01:06:53,455 --> 01:06:54,830
It's okay.

361
01:06:59,503 --> 01:07:01,376
Sir, it's Blonsky.

362
01:07:03,882 --> 01:07:06,800
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

363
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:09,254
Ask him yourself.

364
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:14,137
Sir?

365
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:38,327
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

366
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:46,544
How do you feel?

367
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,918
Pissed off and ready for round three.

368
01:07:57,352 --> 01:08:01,350
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

369
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,227
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

370
01:08:05,193 --> 01:08:08,313
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

371
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:11,322
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

372
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:12,571
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

373
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:16,277
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

374
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:18,660
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

375
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:20,913
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

376
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:24,915
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

377
01:08:27,966 --> 01:08:30,837
Well, we could sell this.

378
01:08:30,927 --> 01:08:34,462
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

379
01:08:36,683 --> 01:08:39,388
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

380
01:08:40,062 --> 01:08:41,971
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

381
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:44,305
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

382
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,641
and local PD have been placed on alert.

383
01:08:46,735 --> 01:08:49,404
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

384
01:08:49,488 --> 01:08:51,445
They're not gonna just pop up.

385
01:08:51,531 --> 01:08:54,568
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

386
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,486
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

387
01:08:56,912 --> 01:08:58,655
<i>If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.</i>

388
01:08:58,747 --> 01:08:59,910
<i>He's not trying to escape this time.</i>

389
01:08:59,998 --> 01:09:02,489
<i>He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.</i>

390
01:09:02,584 --> 01:09:04,992
<i>We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.</i>

391
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:06,913
<i>You all have copies of the correspondence.</i>

392
01:09:07,422 --> 01:09:09,462
<i>The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue</i>

393
01:09:09,549 --> 01:09:11,672
<i>have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.</i>

394
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:14,386
<i>If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.</i>

395
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:17,845
<i>If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.</i>

396
01:09:17,933 --> 01:09:20,340
<i>And when he slips up, we'll be ready.</i>

397
01:10:03,228 --> 01:10:04,343
Hey.

398
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:07,387
Smile.

399
01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:19,486
What is it like?

400
01:10:21,413 --> 01:10:24,165
When it happens, what do you experience?

401
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:27,490
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

402
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:29,662
Those induced hallucinations?

403
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:33,838
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

404
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:39,592
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.

405
01:10:39,681 --> 01:10:44,509
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

406
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:48,187
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

407
01:10:48,273 --> 01:10:51,856
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

408
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:58,443
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

409
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:00,612
Maybe your mind is in there,

410
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:03,324
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

411
01:11:03,413 --> 01:11:06,699
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

412
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,389
Are you ready?

413
01:11:21,473 --> 01:11:23,216
Let's even the playing field a little.

414
01:11:26,645 --> 01:11:27,925
Gentlemen.

415
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,565
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

416
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:49,701
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

417
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:06,808
All right. Come.

418
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:24,945
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

419
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:27,738
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

420
01:12:27,831 --> 01:12:30,287
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

421
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:33,045
Right. Let's get a cab.

422
01:12:33,128 --> 01:12:37,340
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

423
01:12:42,262 --> 01:12:43,840
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

424
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,050
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

425
01:12:47,142 --> 01:12:49,182
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

426
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:55,150
Are you out of your mind?

427
01:12:55,233 --> 01:12:56,562
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

428
01:12:56,652 --> 01:12:58,359
You don't like a good ride?

429
01:13:00,197 --> 01:13:01,442
Asshole!

430
01:13:04,576 --> 01:13:07,067
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

431
01:13:07,162 --> 01:13:11,374
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

432
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:12,823
Okay.

433
01:13:20,384 --> 01:13:22,341
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

434
01:13:22,427 --> 01:13:24,965
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

435
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:27,882
Oh! Dr Ross!

436
01:13:27,975 --> 01:13:30,892
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

437
01:13:33,397 --> 01:13:34,855
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

438
01:13:36,692 --> 01:13:38,067
Mr Green?

439
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,985
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

440
01:13:44,074 --> 01:13:45,817
And if you were, what would it look like?

441
01:13:45,909 --> 01:13:50,571
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

442
01:13:50,664 --> 01:13:52,288
Nothing could have surprised me more

443
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:55,244
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

444
01:13:55,335 --> 01:13:58,005
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

445
01:13:58,088 --> 01:13:59,748
Even if everything goes perfectly,

446
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,672
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

447
01:14:04,678 --> 01:14:06,587
is that going to be a lasting cure

448
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,013
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

449
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:13,769
I don't know.

450
01:14:14,521 --> 01:14:19,230
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

451
01:14:20,193 --> 01:14:25,069
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

452
01:14:25,157 --> 01:14:29,700
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

453
01:14:31,413 --> 01:14:33,536
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

454
01:14:33,623 --> 01:14:37,158
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

455
01:14:37,252 --> 01:14:39,708
this will be very dangerous for you.

456
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:45,551
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

457
01:14:45,636 --> 01:14:49,882
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

458
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:46,569
How you feeling, man?

459
01:15:48,323 --> 01:15:49,901
Like a monster.

460
01:16:09,803 --> 01:16:11,546
Okay. On the table.

461
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:17,680
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

462
01:16:18,937 --> 01:16:21,891
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

463
01:16:26,111 --> 01:16:30,524
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

464
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:36,276
Okay...

465
01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:38,330
You, you, you.

466
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:43,410
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

467
01:16:46,089 --> 01:16:47,584
We have begun.

468
01:16:49,426 --> 01:16:52,462
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

469
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:57,015
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

470
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,263
Just relax.

471
01:16:59,019 --> 01:17:02,352
Okay. We are comprehensive.

472
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:07,026
Here you go.

473
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:19,030
All right. We set to pop?

474
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,700
I'd take your hands off him.

475
01:17:43,522 --> 01:17:45,561
Oh, my God!

476
01:17:59,663 --> 01:18:01,702
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

477
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:15,082
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.

478
01:18:15,178 --> 01:18:17,752
Now, do it! Do it!

479
01:18:25,272 --> 01:18:27,763
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

480
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:32,354
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

481
01:18:33,822 --> 01:18:37,820
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

482
01:18:39,036 --> 01:18:41,443
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

483
01:19:01,058 --> 01:19:02,256
Bruce.

484
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:03,726
Oh, my God.

485
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:18,114
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

486
01:19:22,162 --> 01:19:23,325
Bruce?

487
01:19:32,172 --> 01:19:35,541
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

488
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:40,346
You did it.

489
01:19:40,514 --> 01:19:43,183
He's fine. This is fantastic.

490
01:19:43,266 --> 01:19:44,595
It's over.

491
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:46,598
Hi.

492
01:19:46,937 --> 01:19:48,051
Hi.

493
01:19:56,405 --> 01:20:02,360
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

494
01:20:02,452 --> 01:20:04,030
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

495
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:06,493
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

496
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:10,365
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

497
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,204
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

498
01:20:12,296 --> 01:20:15,546
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

499
01:20:15,632 --> 01:20:18,419
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

500
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,215
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,

501
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:23,214
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

502
01:20:23,307 --> 01:20:25,632
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

503
01:20:25,726 --> 01:20:27,517
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

504
01:20:27,602 --> 01:20:29,227
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

505
01:20:29,313 --> 01:20:30,723
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

506
01:20:30,814 --> 01:20:33,352
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

507
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:36,144
What test subjects?

508
01:20:36,862 --> 01:20:37,893
Come with me.

509
01:20:55,005 --> 01:20:58,919
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

510
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,170
<i>We started on rats and mice,</i>

511
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:03,835
<i>but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.</i>

512
01:21:04,097 --> 01:21:07,217
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

513
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:11,057
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

514
01:21:11,897 --> 01:21:15,895
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

515
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:19,234
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

516
01:21:19,321 --> 01:21:23,021
This is potentially Olympian!

517
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:26,616
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

518
01:21:26,703 --> 01:21:28,743
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

519
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:31,950
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

520
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:47,799
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

521
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:50,140
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

522
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:51,644
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

523
01:21:51,728 --> 01:21:53,970
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

524
01:21:54,064 --> 01:21:55,606
We could get the Nobel for this!

525
01:21:55,691 --> 01:21:57,897
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

526
01:21:57,985 --> 01:22:00,606
It is too dangerous.
It cannot be controlled.

527
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:02,774
At your discretion, shooter.

528
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:04,323
<i>three of us!
This is Promethean fire!</i>

529
01:22:04,408 --> 01:22:05,439
<i>It's just...</i>

530
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:06,779
<i>No shot.</i>

531
01:22:10,122 --> 01:22:11,913
Blonsky's going in.

532
01:22:14,126 --> 01:22:16,996
<i>Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!</i>

533
01:22:19,589 --> 01:22:20,669
We have the antidote now.

534
01:22:20,757 --> 01:22:23,592
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

535
01:22:30,475 --> 01:22:32,468
And if we let it go,
we will never get it back.

536
01:22:32,686 --> 01:22:34,725
<i>You don't know how powerful this thing is.</i>

537
01:22:34,813 --> 01:22:36,806
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

538
01:22:36,898 --> 01:22:38,690
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

539
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:47,986
Bruce! Bruce!

540
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:50,948
Get out.

541
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:56,959
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

542
01:23:01,173 --> 01:23:02,833
Show him to me.

543
01:23:04,343 --> 01:23:05,623
Blonsky!

544
01:23:14,102 --> 01:23:15,182
Miss!

545
01:23:16,688 --> 01:23:18,064
Take this.

546
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:26,272
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

547
01:23:32,037 --> 01:23:33,200
Betty.

548
01:23:35,165 --> 01:23:38,166
I will never forgive
what you've done to him.

549
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:39,580
He's a fugitive.

550
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:41,627
You made him a fugitive

551
01:23:41,713 --> 01:23:45,213
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

552
01:23:46,009 --> 01:23:48,844
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

553
01:23:51,098 --> 01:23:54,597
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

554
01:23:59,523 --> 01:24:00,721
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

555
01:24:00,816 --> 01:24:05,561
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

556
01:24:05,654 --> 01:24:08,987
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

557
01:24:09,074 --> 01:24:12,941
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

558
01:24:13,036 --> 01:24:14,945
So Banner's the only...

559
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:23,163
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

560
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:30,667
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

561
01:24:30,762 --> 01:24:33,467
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

562
01:24:34,433 --> 01:24:36,888
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

563
01:24:40,397 --> 01:24:44,442
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

564
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:49,396
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

565
01:24:50,115 --> 01:24:51,313
I have.

566
01:24:52,284 --> 01:24:53,826
And it's beautiful.

567
01:24:54,661 --> 01:24:55,906
Godlike.

568
01:24:56,121 --> 01:24:57,829
Well, I want that.

569
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,076
I need that. Make me that.

570
01:25:02,961 --> 01:25:05,962
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

571
01:25:06,048 --> 01:25:07,625
The mix could be

572
01:25:08,258 --> 01:25:09,800
an abomination.

573
01:25:13,472 --> 01:25:16,307
I didn't say I was unwilling.

574
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:20,599
I just need informed consent.

575
01:25:23,106 --> 01:25:24,898
And you've given it.

576
01:26:06,024 --> 01:26:10,271
This is what I was trying to explain.

577
01:26:10,362 --> 01:26:15,273
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

578
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:17,443
But clearly it worked.

579
01:26:17,536 --> 01:26:21,154
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

580
01:26:21,248 --> 01:26:26,076
but if you'll just get back on the table,

581
01:26:26,169 --> 01:26:28,660
I can fix this.

582
01:26:43,562 --> 01:26:45,270
Shoot it!
- Hey!

583
01:26:46,064 --> 01:26:47,143
No!

584
01:26:56,742 --> 01:26:58,781
Delta 4 to Leader.

585
01:26:58,869 --> 01:27:00,612
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

586
01:27:00,704 --> 01:27:03,409
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

587
01:27:06,293 --> 01:27:08,582
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

588
01:27:16,553 --> 01:27:18,131
It's over there!

589
01:27:19,931 --> 01:27:21,094
Drop them!

590
01:27:21,183 --> 01:27:23,425
What is that thing?
- Shoot it!

591
01:27:32,903 --> 01:27:36,687
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

592
01:27:36,782 --> 01:27:38,110
Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

593
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,109
Something big
just went off down here!

594
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:42,783
General, you should hear this!

595
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:45,789
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

596
01:27:48,377 --> 01:27:50,453
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

597
01:27:50,545 --> 01:27:52,455
You get it together. What is your position?

598
01:27:52,714 --> 01:27:55,834
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

599
01:27:55,926 --> 01:27:57,468
Turn us around.

600
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:07,638
We're going back. Why are we going back?

601
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:09,354
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

602
01:28:09,773 --> 01:28:11,053
Yes, sir!

603
01:28:13,068 --> 01:28:14,977
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

604
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,945
Go, go, go!

605
01:28:40,512 --> 01:28:41,757
No!

606
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,358
One of yours?

607
01:28:59,614 --> 01:29:02,699
Oh, my God. What have you done?

608
01:29:05,037 --> 01:29:06,863
Fire at him, fire at him!

609
01:29:11,209 --> 01:29:13,285
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

610
01:29:13,712 --> 01:29:14,957
Come on!

611
01:29:18,467 --> 01:29:19,629
Sweet.

612
01:29:22,554 --> 01:29:23,752
Booyah!

613
01:29:41,782 --> 01:29:43,110
Get out of there, soldier!

614
01:29:46,453 --> 01:29:48,078
Stacy!

615
01:30:18,735 --> 01:30:20,644
Give me a real fight!

616
01:30:28,745 --> 01:30:29,908
Sir?

617
01:30:32,582 --> 01:30:33,697
Sir?

618
01:30:35,252 --> 01:30:38,253
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

619
01:30:41,633 --> 01:30:45,085
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

620
01:30:45,429 --> 01:30:46,971
What are you saying?

621
01:30:47,139 --> 01:30:48,419
You think you can control it?

622
01:30:48,515 --> 01:30:51,635
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

623
01:30:51,727 --> 01:30:53,185
And what if you can't?

624
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,473
We made this thing.

625
01:30:56,982 --> 01:30:58,310
All of us.

626
01:30:59,318 --> 01:31:00,516
Please.

627
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:07,981
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

628
01:31:09,578 --> 01:31:10,906
Open the back door.

629
01:31:16,668 --> 01:31:21,544
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

630
01:31:21,632 --> 01:31:25,332
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

631
01:31:27,346 --> 01:31:30,549
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

632
01:31:30,641 --> 01:31:32,384
Betty, I've got to try.

633
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:35,890
I'm sorry.

634
01:31:58,543 --> 01:32:00,203
Oh, shit!

635
01:32:04,216 --> 01:32:07,051
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

636
01:32:24,486 --> 01:32:26,526
There. Betty!

637
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:47,133
Hulk!

638
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:53,638
Yeah!

639
01:33:37,893 --> 01:33:39,138
Come on!

640
01:34:11,385 --> 01:34:13,342
Is that all you've got?

641
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:29,854
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

642
01:34:29,945 --> 01:34:31,190
Which one?

643
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:33,605
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

644
01:34:33,699 --> 01:34:35,525
Cut the other one in half!

645
01:34:38,203 --> 01:34:39,366
Ross!

646
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:05,889
Keep it on him!

647
01:35:34,092 --> 01:35:37,093
Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!

648
01:36:44,329 --> 01:36:45,444
Dad?

649
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,574
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

650
01:36:58,343 --> 01:37:00,217
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

651
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:54,727
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

652
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:47,110
Look out!

653
01:39:17,941 --> 01:39:19,186
General?

654
01:39:25,449 --> 01:39:28,022
Any last words?

655
01:39:30,829 --> 01:39:34,245
Hulk smash!

656
01:40:21,797 --> 01:40:23,374
Stop!

657
01:41:44,129 --> 01:41:45,457
It's okay.

658
01:41:55,599 --> 01:41:57,259
Betty.

659
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:26,619
Reload.

660
01:44:34,174 --> 01:44:35,372
Reload.

661
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:54,566
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

662
01:44:54,653 --> 01:44:56,396
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

663
01:44:56,488 --> 01:45:00,901
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

664
01:45:00,993 --> 01:45:03,863
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

665
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:06,368
- Stark.
- General.

666
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:11,200
You always wear such nice suits.

667
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,499
Touché.

668
01:45:14,423 --> 01:45:18,123
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

669
01:45:18,218 --> 01:45:19,712
You should listen.

670
01:45:22,389 --> 01:45:25,211
What if I told you we were
putting a team together?

671
01:45:25,976 --> 01:45:27,553
Who's "we"?
